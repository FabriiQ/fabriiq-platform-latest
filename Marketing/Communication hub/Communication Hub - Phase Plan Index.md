# Communication Hub — Compliance-Ready Phase Plan (Index)

This index summarizes all phase-wise plans to make the Communication Hub compliance-ready while reusing the existing Social Wall. Each phase links to a dedicated task file with objectives, scope, tasks, references, acceptance criteria, and test plans.

- Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Compliance Foundations — see: "Communication Hub - Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure.md"
- Phase 2: Admin Portals (System Admin, Campus Admin) — see: "Communication Hub - Phase 2 - Admin Pages.md"
- Phase 3: Moderation Enhancements — see: "Communication Hub - Phase 3 - Moderation.md"
- Phase 4: Smart (Non-AI) Features — see: "Communication Hub - Phase 4 - Smart Features.md"
- Phase 5: Scheduled Analysis (Cron) — see: "Communication Hub - Phase 5 - Cron & Analysis.md"
- Phase 6: Social Wall Integration & Rollout — see: "Communication Hub - Phase 6 - Integration.md"

Key design drivers:
- Compliance-first (FERPA/GDPR/PDPL-ready) with consent, audit, retention, encryption
- Reuse existing Social Wall for UI, layout, and feed mechanics
- Non-AI, rule-based classification and suggestions
