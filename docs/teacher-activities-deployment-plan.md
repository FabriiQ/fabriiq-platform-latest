# Teacher Activities Deployment Plan

This document outlines the plan for deploying the enhanced teacher activities components.

## Overview

The enhanced teacher activities components use the new activities architecture from the `features/activities` folder. They provide a more consistent and maintainable approach to teacher activities, leveraging the activity registry to load the appropriate editor and viewer components for each activity type.

## Components

The enhanced components are located in the `src/components/teacher/activities/enhanced` directory:

- `ActivityTypeSelectorGrid`: A grid of activity types for selection
- `UnifiedActivityCreator`: A unified component for creating activities of any type
- `ActivityViewer`: A component for viewing activities
- `ActivityEditor`: A component for editing activities
- `ActivityAnalyticsWrapper`: A wrapper for activity analytics

## Pages

Enhanced versions of the teacher activities pages are available with the `.enhanced.tsx` extension:

- `src/app/teacher/classes/[classId]/activities/page.enhanced.tsx`
- `src/app/teacher/classes/[classId]/activities/create/page.enhanced.tsx`
- `src/app/teacher/classes/[classId]/activities/[activityId]/page.enhanced.tsx`
- `src/app/teacher/classes/[classId]/activities/[activityId]/grade/page.enhanced.tsx`

## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Preparation

1. Ensure that the activity registry is properly initialized in the `src/components/shared/entities/activities/register-activities.ts` file
2. Verify that all activity types are registered and their editor and viewer components are available
3. Run tests to ensure that the enhanced components work correctly

### Phase 2: Deployment

1. Create a backup of the existing files
2. Deploy the enhanced components to the `src/components/teacher/activities/enhanced` directory
3. Update the imports in the enhanced pages to use the enhanced components
4. Create a README file to explain how to use the enhanced components

### Phase 3: Testing

1. Test the enhanced components in a development environment
2. Verify that all activity types can be created, viewed, and edited
3. Test the grading functionality
4. Test the analytics functionality

### Phase 4: Rollout

1. Start by using the enhanced components in new pages
2. Test thoroughly to ensure compatibility with your data
3. Gradually replace the original components with the enhanced components
4. Update the imports in your existing pages to use the enhanced components

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered during deployment:

1. Revert to the original components by updating the imports in your pages
2. Use the backup files to restore the original files if necessary
3. Document the issues encountered and create a plan to address them

## Future Work

The following components are planned for future implementation:

- `ActivityList`: A component for listing activities
- `ActivityGrading`: A component for grading activities
- `BatchGrading`: A component for batch grading activities

Once these components are implemented, the enhanced components will provide a complete replacement for the original components.
