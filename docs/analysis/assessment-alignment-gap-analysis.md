# Assessment System Gap Analysis & Alignment Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive gap analysis of the current assessment system and outlines a plan to align it with the newly implemented topic-based learning outcomes, rubrics, and criteria system. The goal is to ensure assessments fully support rubric-based grading and integrate seamlessly with the Bloom's Taxonomy framework.

## Current State Analysis

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Data Migration Complexity**
   - Risk: Data loss or corruption during migration
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive backup and rollback procedures

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Risk: Slower queries due to complex joins
   - Mitigation: Database indexing optimization and caching

3. **Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: Breaking existing functionality
   - Mitigation: Gradual rollout with feature flags

### User Experience Risks
1. **Learning Curve**
   - Risk: Teachers struggling with new interface
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive training and documentation

2. **Workflow Disruption**
   - Risk: Interruption to current assessment practices
   - Mitigation: Parallel system operation during transition

## Conclusion

The assessment system requires significant updates to align with the new topic-based learning outcomes and rubric system. The proposed plan addresses all identified gaps while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring a smooth transition for users. The phased approach allows for iterative development and testing, minimizing disruption to current operations while delivering substantial improvements to the assessment and grading experience.
