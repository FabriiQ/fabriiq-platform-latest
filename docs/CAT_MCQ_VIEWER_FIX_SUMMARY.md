# CAT Multiple Choice Question Viewer Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The CAT (Computer Adaptive Testing) activity multiple choice question viewer had consistent selection issues where options could not be properly selected. The component lacked the enhanced interactivity, animations, and user experience features present in the legacy activities question viewer.

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Interactive Features**: The CAT viewer lacked enhanced interactivity, animations, and touch support
2. **Poor Visual Feedback**: Basic styling without sophisticated hover states, touch feedback, and animations
3. **Missing Accessibility Features**: No proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, or accessibility features
4. **Inconsistent Styling**: Different color schemes that didn't align with brand colors
5. **Missing Enhanced UX**: No pulse animations, shake effects for touch feedback, or visual indicators

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced SelectableOption Component

Created an enhanced `SelectableOption` component within the `MultipleChoiceQuestionViewer` that includes:

- **Touch and Hover Support**: Proper state management for hover and touch interactions
- **Animation System**: Pulse animations for selection feedback and shake animations for touch feedback
- **Accessibility Features**: ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation (Enter/Space keys), and proper focus management
- **Brand Color Alignment**: Uses primary-green, medium-teal, and light-mint colors consistent with the design system

### 2. Key Features Added

#### Visual Feedback
- **Selection States**: Clear visual indication when options are selected
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth transitions and scaling effects on hover
- **Touch Feedback**: Immediate visual response to touch interactions
- **Status Indicators**: Check/X icons for correct/incorrect answers in feedback mode

#### Animations
- **Pulse Animation**: Added to global CSS for selection feedback
- **Shake Animation**: For touch feedback on mobile devices
- **Smooth Transitions**: All state changes have smooth transitions

#### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full support for Tab, Enter, and Space key navigation
- **ARIA Attributes**: Proper `role="radio"` and `aria-checked` attributes
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus states and tabindex management

### 3. Files Modified

  - Added enhanced SelectableOption component
  - Integrated theme support
  - Added proper state management
  - Implemented accessibility features

#### Global Styles
- `src/app/globals.css`
  - Added pulse-animation keyframes and class
  - Ensured consistent animation support

#### Test Files
- `src/features/activities-v2/components/quiz/question-viewers/__tests__/MultipleChoiceQuestionViewer.test.tsx`

  - Demonstrates all features and states

### 4. Technical Implementation Details

#### Theme Integration
```typescript
const { theme } = useTheme();
```
- Proper integration with the application's theme system
- Consistent styling across light/dark modes

#### State Management
```typescript
const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);
const [isTouched, setIsTouched] = useState(false);
```
- Separate state for hover and touch interactions
- Automatic cleanup of touch states

#### Animation System
```typescript
if (optionRef.current) {
  optionRef.current.classList.add('pulse-animation');
  setTimeout(() => {
    optionRef.current?.classList.remove('pulse-animation');
  }, 500);
}
```
- CSS class-based animations for better performance
- Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### 5. Brand Color Implementation

The component now uses the proper brand colors:
- **Primary Green**: `#1F504B` for selected states
- **Medium Teal**: `#5A8A84` for hover states  
- **Light Mint**: `#D8E3E0` for background highlights

### 6. Testing and Verification

#### Manual Testing
- Created test page at `/test-mcq` for interactive testing
- Verified selection, hover, keyboard navigation, and feedback modes

#### Automated Testing
- Comprehensive Jest test suite covering all functionality
- Tests for accessibility, keyboard navigation, and state management

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Improved User Experience**: Smooth animations and clear visual feedback
2. **Better Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and ARIA support
3. **Consistent Design**: Aligned with brand colors and design system
4. **Mobile Friendly**: Enhanced touch interactions and responsive design
