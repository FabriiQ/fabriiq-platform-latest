# Unified Components Proposal

## Overview

This document presents a comprehensive proposal for unifying components across different portals in our application. The goal is to improve code reusability, maintainability, and consistency while providing a seamless user experience across different roles.

## Current Challenges

Our application currently faces several challenges related to component architecture:

1. **Duplication of Components**: Similar components are implemented multiple times across different portals (System Admin, Campus Admin, Coordinator, Teacher, Student).

2. **Inconsistent User Experience**: Different implementations lead to inconsistent behavior and appearance across portals.

3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Changes to functionality require updates in multiple places.

4. **Development Inefficiency**: New features require reimplementing similar components for different roles.

5. **Testing Complexity**: Multiple implementations of similar components increase testing effort.

## Proposed Solution

We propose creating a unified component architecture with the following key principles:

1. **Role-Based Rendering**: Components adapt their appearance and functionality based on the user's role.

2. **Composition Over Inheritance**: Build complex components by composing simpler, reusable components.

3. **Single Source of Truth**: Maintain one implementation of each component type.

4. **Consistent Design Language**: Ensure consistent styling and behavior across all components.

5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Components should work with basic functionality and enhance features based on permissions.

## Component Architecture

### Core Structure

```
/src/components/shared/
├── entities/
│   ├── teachers/
│   ├── students/
│   ├── courses/
│   ├── classes/
│   ├── attendance/
│   ├── assessments/
│   └── activities/
├── analytics/
├── reports/
├── visualizations/
└── common/
    ├── layout/
    ├── navigation/
    ├── forms/
    └── feedback/
```

### Entity Component Pattern

For each entity (Teachers, Students, Courses, etc.), we will follow a consistent pattern:

1. **Card Component**: Display entity in a card format
   - Adapts to different view modes (full, compact, mobile)
   - Shows role-appropriate information and actions

2. **List Component**: Display a list of entities with filtering
   - Adapts to different view modes (grid, table, mobile)
   - Shows role-appropriate filters and actions

3. **Detail Component**: Display detailed entity information
   - Shows role-appropriate tabs and sections
   - Provides role-appropriate actions

4. **Form Component**: Create/edit entity information
   - Shows role-appropriate fields and validation
   - Handles permissions for different operations

### Role-Based Rendering

Each component will accept a `userRole` prop that determines:

1. **Visible Information**: What data is displayed
2. **Available Actions**: What actions are permitted
3. **Layout Options**: How information is organized
4. **Interaction Level**: Read-only vs. editable

Example implementation:

```tsx
interface TeacherCardProps {
  teacher: TeacherData;
  viewMode: 'full' | 'compact' | 'mobile';
  userRole: UserRole;
  actions?: string[];
  onAction?: (action: string, teacherId: string) => void;
}

export function TeacherCard({ 
  teacher, 
  viewMode, 
  userRole, 
  actions = [], 
  onAction 
}: TeacherCardProps) {
  // Get role-specific configuration
  const config = getRoleConfig(userRole, 'teacherCard');
  
  // Determine visible fields based on role and viewMode
  const visibleFields = config.visibleFields[viewMode];
  
  // Determine available actions based on role and provided actions
  const availableActions = actions.filter(action => 
    config.allowedActions.includes(action)
  );
  
  return (
    <Card className={viewMode === 'compact' ? 'p-4' : 'p-6'}>
      <CardHeader>
        {/* Render header based on viewMode */}
        {viewMode !== 'mobile' && (
          <CardTitle>{teacher.name}</CardTitle>
        )}
        {viewMode === 'mobile' ? (
          <MobileTeacherHeader teacher={teacher} />
        ) : (
          <TeacherHeader teacher={teacher} visibleFields={visibleFields} />
        )}
      </CardHeader>
      
      <CardContent>
        {/* Render content based on visibleFields */}
        {visibleFields.includes('email') && (
          <div className="flex items-center">
            <Mail className="h-4 w-4 mr-2 text-muted-foreground" />
            <span>{teacher.email}</span>
          </div>
        )}
        {/* Additional fields based on visibleFields */}
      </CardContent>
      
      {availableActions.length > 0 && (
        <CardFooter>
          {/* Render actions based on availableActions */}
          {availableActions.map(action => (
            <Button 
              key={action}
              variant="outline"
              size="sm"
              onClick={() => onAction?.(action, teacher.id)}
            >
              {getActionLabel(action)}
            </Button>
          ))}
        </CardFooter>
      )}
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

The proposed unified component architecture addresses the current challenges of component duplication and inconsistency across our application. By implementing role-based rendering and following a consistent component pattern, we can significantly improve code quality, user experience, and development efficiency.

This approach allows us to maintain a single source of truth for each component type while adapting the behavior and appearance based on the user's role. The phased implementation plan ensures a smooth transition with minimal disruption to ongoing development.

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve the proposed architecture
2. Prioritize entities for implementation
3. Create detailed technical specifications for each component
4. Set up the shared component structure
5. Begin implementation of Phase 1 components
