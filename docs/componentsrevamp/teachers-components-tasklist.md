# Teachers Components Task List

This document outlines the tasks required to implement the unified teacher-related components as proposed in the Teachers Components Analysis document. The goal is to create a set of shared, role-based components that can be used across all portals in the application.

## Design Principles

- **Mobile-First**: All components should be designed with mobile-first approach
- **Role-Based Rendering**: Components should adapt based on user role
- **Performance Optimized**: Components should be optimized for fast loading and rendering
- **Accessibility**: Components should follow accessibility best practices
- **Consistent UI/UX**: Components should follow the design system
