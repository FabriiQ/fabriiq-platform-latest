# Entity Components Master Task List

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all entity component tasks that need to be implemented as part of the component unification initiative. It serves as a master reference for planning and tracking progress across all entity types.

## Overview

The goal is to create unified, role-based components for each entity type in the application. These components will be shared across all portals (System Admin, Campus Admin, Coordinator, Teacher, Student) and will adapt their behavior and appearance based on the user's role.

## Design Principles

- **Mobile-First**: All components should be designed with mobile-first approach
- **Role-Based Rendering**: Components should adapt based on user role
- **Performance Optimized**: Components should be optimized for fast loading and rendering
- **Accessibility**: Components should follow accessibility best practices
- **Consistent UI/UX**: Components should follow the design system

## Entity Component Sets

| Entity Type | Status | Estimated Hours | Priority | Dependencies |
|-------------|--------|-----------------|----------|--------------|
| Classes | In Progress | 90 | High | UI Components |
| Teachers | Not Started | 70 | High | UI Components |
| Students | Not Started | 78 | High | UI Components |
| Programs | Not Started | 86 | Medium | UI Components |
| Courses | Not Started | 78 | Medium | UI Components, Programs |
| Assessments & Activities | Not Started | 110 | Medium | UI Components, Classes |
| Attendance | Not Started | 82 | Medium | UI Components, Classes, Students |
| Analytics & Reports | Not Started | 94 | Low | UI Components, All Entities |
| **Total** | | **688** | | |

## Component Pattern

Each entity type follows a consistent component pattern:

1. **Card Component**: Display entity in a card format
   - Adapts to different view modes (full, compact, mobile)
   - Shows role-appropriate information and actions

2. **List Component**: Display a list of entities with filtering
   - Adapts to different view modes (grid, table, mobile)
   - Shows role-appropriate filters and actions

3. **Detail Component**: Display detailed entity information
   - Shows role-appropriate tabs and sections
   - Provides role-appropriate actions

4. **Form Component**: Create/edit entity information
   - Shows role-appropriate fields and validation
   - Handles permissions for different operations

5. **Supporting Components**:
   - **Actions Component**: Action buttons for entity management
   - **Filters Component**: Filter controls for entity lists
   - **Tabs Component**: Tab container for entity detail view

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

- Complete UI component library unification
- Implement Classes components (already in progress)
- Create shared types and utilities

### Phase 2: Core Entities (Weeks 3-6)

- Implement Teachers components
- Implement Students components
- Implement Programs components
- Implement Courses components

### Phase 3: Supporting Entities (Weeks 7-10)

- Implement Assessments & Activities components
- Implement Attendance components
- Begin integration with existing pages

### Phase 4: Analytics and Integration (Weeks 11-14)

- Implement Analytics & Reports components
- Complete integration with existing pages
- Perform testing and optimization
- Create documentation and examples

## Resource Allocation

- **2 Senior Frontend Developers**: Lead implementation of core components
- **2 Frontend Developers**: Implement supporting components and tests
- **1 UI/UX Designer**: Ensure consistent design
- **1 QA Engineer**: Test components and integration

## Success Metrics

- **Code Reduction**: Measure reduction in lines of code
- **Component Reuse**: Track usage of shared components
- **Performance**: Measure load time and rendering performance
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Survey developers on component usability
- **User Experience**: Test with end users for consistency and usability

## Detailed Task Lists

For detailed tasks for each entity type, refer to the individual task list documents:

- [Classes Components Task List](./classes-components-tasklist.md)
- [Teachers Components Task List](./teachers-components-tasklist.md)
- [Students Components Task List](./students-components-tasklist.md)
- [Programs Components Task List](./programs-components-tasklist.md)
- [Courses Components Task List](./courses-components-tasklist.md)
- [Assessments & Activities Components Task List](./assessments-activities-components-tasklist.md)
- [Attendance Components Task List](./attendance-components-tasklist.md)
- [Analytics & Reports Components Task List](./analytics-reports-components-tasklist.md)

## Dependencies

- UI component library (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- Role-based authentication system
- API endpoints for entity data
- Nivo charts library for visualizations
- Date handling libraries

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Scope creep | High | Medium | Clearly define component boundaries and stick to them |
| Performance issues | High | Low | Implement virtualization and optimization techniques |
| Browser compatibility | Medium | Low | Test across browsers and use polyfills where needed |
| API changes | Medium | Medium | Design components to be resilient to API changes |
| Resource constraints | High | Medium | Prioritize components based on business value |

## Conclusion

This master task list provides a comprehensive overview of the entity component implementation work. By following this plan, we will create a unified, consistent component library that improves code reusability, maintainability, and user experience across all portals in the application.
