# Learning Outcome Criteria: User Training Guide

## Introduction

This training guide will help you understand and use the new Learning Outcome Criteria feature, which allows you to create and manage rubric criteria directly within learning outcomes. This integration streamlines assessment creation and ensures consistent evaluation standards across your curriculum.

## What You'll Learn

- How to create learning outcomes with rubric criteria
- How to edit and customize criteria and performance levels
- How to use learning outcome criteria in assessments
- Best practices for creating effective criteria

## Getting Started

### Accessing Learning Outcomes

1. Log in to your account
2. Navigate to the Admin section
3. Select "Subjects" from the menu
4. Choose a subject
5. Click on "Learning Outcomes" or select a specific topic to manage its learning outcomes

### Understanding the Interface

The learning outcome management interface now includes:

- **Details Tab**: Contains the basic learning outcome information (statement, Bloom's level, action verbs)
- **Rubric Criteria Tab**: Where you can enable and manage criteria
- **Criteria Toggle**: Enables/disables criteria for a learning outcome
- **Criteria Editor**: Interface for adding and editing criteria
- **Performance Levels Editor**: Interface for defining performance levels
- **Preview Section**: Shows how the criteria will appear in a rubric

## Step-by-Step Tutorials

### Creating a Learning Outcome with Criteria

1. Click "Add Learning Outcome" on the learning outcomes page
2. Fill in the basic details in the "Details" tab:
   - Statement: What students will be able to do
   - Bloom's Taxonomy Level: Select the appropriate cognitive level
   - Action Verbs: Choose verbs that align with the selected level
   - Description: Add any additional details (optional)
3. Switch to the "Rubric Criteria" tab
4. Toggle "Enable Rubric Criteria" to ON
5. The system will automatically generate default criteria based on the selected Bloom's level
6. Customize the criteria as needed:
   - Edit names and descriptions
   - Adjust Bloom's levels if necessary
   - Set weights for each criterion
7. Customize performance levels if needed:
   - Edit names and descriptions
   - Adjust score percentages
   - Change colors for visual identification
8. Click "Create Learning Outcome" to save

### Editing Criteria for an Existing Learning Outcome

1. Find the learning outcome in the list
2. Click the "Edit" button
3. Switch to the "Rubric Criteria" tab
4. Make your changes to criteria and performance levels
5. Click "Save Changes"

### Adding a New Criterion

1. In the criteria editor, click "Add Criterion"
2. Fill in the details:
   - Name: A short, descriptive title
   - Description: Detailed explanation of what is being assessed
   - Bloom's Level: Select the appropriate cognitive level
   - Weight: Set the importance factor (1-5)
3. The new criterion will use the existing performance levels

### Adding a New Performance Level

1. In the performance levels tab, click "Add Level"
2. Fill in the details:
   - Name: The level title (e.g., "Exceeds Expectations")
   - Description: What performance at this level looks like
   - Score Percentage: The score associated with this level
   - Color: Choose a color for visual identification
3. The new level will be applied to all criteria

### Using Learning Outcome Criteria in Assessments

1. When creating an assessment, select the "Learning Outcomes" section
2. Choose learning outcomes for your assessment
3. Learning outcomes with criteria will be marked with a "Has Rubric Criteria" indicator
4. In the rubric section of the assessment, click "Import from Learning Outcomes"
5. Select the criteria you want to include in your assessment rubric
6. Customize as needed for the specific assessment
7. Save your assessment

## Advanced Features

### Reordering Criteria

Use the up and down arrows next to each criterion to change their order of importance.

### Customizing Performance Levels

You can create custom performance levels for different types of assessments:

- **Standard Levels**: Exceeds/Meets/Approaching/Below Expectations
- **Numeric Levels**: 4/3/2/1
- **Custom Terminology**: Expert/Proficient/Developing/Novice

### Copying Criteria Between Learning Outcomes

Currently, you need to create criteria for each learning outcome individually. In the future, we'll add the ability to copy criteria between learning outcomes.

## Best Practices

### Creating Effective Criteria

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define what you're assessing
2. **Use Measurable Language**: Focus on observable behaviors
3. **Align with Bloom's Level**: Ensure criteria match the cognitive complexity
4. **Keep it Manageable**: Limit to 3-5 criteria per learning outcome
5. **Use Student-Friendly Language**: Write so students understand expectations

### Defining Performance Levels

1. **Clear Distinctions**: Make clear differences between levels
2. **Positive Language**: Focus on what students can do at each level
3. **Consistent Structure**: Use similar language patterns across levels
4. **Appropriate Scoring**: Ensure score percentages reflect your grading policy

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Changes Not Saving**
   - Make sure to click the "Save Changes" button after making edits
   - Check your internet connection

2. **Criteria Not Appearing in Assessment**
   - Verify the learning outcome has criteria enabled
   - Check that you've selected the correct learning outcomes

3. **Performance Levels Not Displaying Correctly**
   - Ensure you have defined at least one performance level
   - Check that score percentages are between 0-100

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered in this guide:
1. Check the full documentation in the Help Center
2. Contact your system administrator
3. Submit a support ticket through the Help menu

## Next Steps

- Explore the Analytics section to see how criteria affect student performance tracking
- Try creating assessments that use learning outcome criteria
- Provide feedback on the feature through the Feedback form

Thank you for using the Learning Outcome Criteria feature! This integration will help create more consistent, standards-based assessments throughout your curriculum.
