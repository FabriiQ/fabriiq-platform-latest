- ✅ `QuickPointsAwarder`: One-click interface for awarding points (Implemented)
  - *Picture Superiority Effect*: Visual information is remembered better than text
  - *Hick's Law*: Reduce choices to speed up decision-making
  - *Fitts's Law*: Make touch targets appropriately sized and positioned
- ✅ `MinimalistLeaderboard`: Clean, focused leaderboard design (Implemented)
  - *Social Comparison Theory*: Motivate students through positive competition
  - *Goal Gradient Effect*: Show progress toward next rank
  - *Status Seeking*: Tap into desire for status recognition
- `MinimalistStudentRewards`: Clean view of student progress
  - *Collection Set Effect*: Tap into desire to complete collections
  - *Peak-End Rule*: Highlight peak performances to create positive memories

**Leveraging Existing API Endpoints**:
- ✅ `api.points.awardPoints`: Already implemented, using for awarding points
- ✅ `api.leaderboard.getClassLeaderboard`: Already implemented, using for leaderboard
- `api.rewards.getStudentRewardsProfile`: Already implemented, will use for student profiles

**Timeline**: 2 weeks (66% completed)

## Technical Approach

### Minimalist Design Principles

1. **Information Hierarchy**:
   - Prioritize essential information with visual emphasis
   - Use white space to create focus and reduce cognitive load
   - Implement progressive disclosure for complex data
   - Apply the "less is more" principle throughout the UI

2. **Visual Psychology**:
   - Use limited, purposeful color palette for emotional impact
   - Apply consistent visual language for better recognition
   - Implement subtle animations to enhance understanding
   - Use visual metaphors that align with mental models

### Leveraging Existing Backend

1. **API Integration**:
   - Use existing API endpoints with minimal extensions
   - Implement client-side data transformations to minimize backend changes
   - Utilize existing caching mechanisms for performance
   - Add parameters for time tracking data where needed

2. **Offline Support**:
   - Leverage existing IndexedDB implementation
   - Implement optimistic UI updates for offline actions
   - Prioritize critical data for offline caching
   - Ensure consistent UI experience in offline mode

### Mobile-First Implementation

1. **Touch-Optimized Interface**:
   - Design for smallest screens first with progressive enhancement
   - Apply Fitts's Law with appropriately sized touch targets
   - Implement touch-friendly interaction patterns
   - Use responsive typography and spacing

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Create lightweight, performant visualizations
   - Implement skeleton loading states for perceived performance
   - Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations
   - Optimize chart rendering for mobile devices

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Verify correct data processing and visualization
   - Ensure proper error handling

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the integration of components with API endpoints
   - Verify offline functionality works correctly
   - Test synchronization of offline data

3. **User Testing**:
   - Conduct usability testing with real teachers
   - Gather feedback on the usefulness of analytics
   - Identify areas for improvement

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Task | Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Enhanced Class Overview Analytics | 2 weeks | None |
| 2 | Activity Analytics with Time Tracking | 2 weeks | None |
| 3 | Minimalist Rewards and Leaderboard System | 2 weeks | None |
| 4 | Testing and Refinement | 1 week | Phases 1-3 |
| 5 | Documentation and Training | 1 week | Phases 1-3 |

**Total Duration**: 6 weeks

**Note**: Since we're leveraging existing backend services and API endpoints, we can implement these phases in parallel if needed, potentially reducing the total timeline.

## Success Criteria

1. **Visual Memorability**:
   - Teachers can quickly recognize and interpret analytics at a glance
   - The interface is visually distinctive and memorable
   - Visual elements effectively communicate meaning without excessive text
