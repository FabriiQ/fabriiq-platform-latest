# FabriiQ Performance Crisis - Comprehensive Cleanup Plan

## üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS SUMMARY

Based on comprehensive codebase analysis, FabriiQ is suffering from severe architectural overflow causing:

- **74+ seconds per page load** due to database introspection
- **281 redundant timezone queries** (22+ seconds)
- **Multiple competing authentication systems** running simultaneously
- **177+ dependencies** with massive redundancy
- **97+ database tables without Row Level Security**
- **45+ npm scripts** indicating system complexity overflow
- **50+ documentation files** cluttering root directory

## üìã PHASE-WISE CLEANUP STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Critical Authentication & Database Cleanup (IMMEDIATE - Week 1)

**Expected Impact**: 80% performance improvement

#### 1.1: Consolidate Authentication Systems ‚ö° CRITICAL
- **Problem**: NextAuth.js + Supabase Auth + Custom JWT + Session-based auth all running
- **Solution**: Standardize on NextAuth.js only
- **Files to Remove**:
  - `src/lib/supabase/auth.ts` (if exists)
  - Custom JWT handlers
  - Duplicate session management
- **Files to Update**:
  - `src/lib/auth.ts` - Remove competing systems
  - `src/middleware.ts` - Simplify auth middleware
  - All login components - Use single auth flow

#### 1.2: Implement Database Query Optimization ‚ö° CRITICAL
- **Problem**: N+1 queries, missing indexes, 27+ seconds schema introspection
- **Solution**: Add indexes, implement caching, disable admin introspection
- **Actions**:
  - Add indexes to frequently queried columns
  - Implement query result caching with LRU
  - Disable Supabase admin panel in production
  - Cache database metadata at startup

#### 1.3: Fix Database Connection Pool Issues ‚ö° CRITICAL
- **Problem**: Multiple database roles causing connection thrashing
- **Solution**: Consolidate to single application role
- **Actions**:
  - Use single database role for app queries
  - Reserve admin role only for actual admin operations
  - Implement proper connection pooling limits
  - Set connection timeouts and limits

#### 1.4: Disable Admin Tools in Production ‚ö° CRITICAL
- **Problem**: Database introspection running in production
- **Solution**: Separate admin from user operations
- **Actions**:
  - Move admin panel to separate subdomain/port
  - Disable database introspection for user requests
  - Use static API definitions instead of runtime discovery

#### 1.5: Implement Static Data Caching ‚ö° CRITICAL
- **Problem**: 281 timezone queries, repeated static data fetching
- **Solution**: Cache all static data at application startup
- **Actions**:
  - Pre-load timezone data at startup
  - Cache database metadata for hours
  - Use static JSON files for reference data
  - Implement memory caching for frequent data

### Phase 2: Dependency & Component Consolidation (Week 2)

**Expected Impact**: 60% bundle size reduction, faster builds

#### 2.1: Remove Redundant Dependencies
**Redundant UI Libraries** (Choose ONE):
- ‚ùå Remove: `@radix-ui/*` (20+ packages) OR `shadcn/ui`
- ‚ùå Remove: `@tiptap/*` (15+ packages) OR `@udecode/plate*` (30+ packages)
- ‚ùå Remove: `@heroicons/react` OR `lucide-react`

**Redundant State Management** (Choose ONE):
- ‚ùå Remove: `zustand` OR React Context API
- ‚úÖ Keep: `@tanstack/react-query` (essential for caching)

**Redundant Drag & Drop** (Choose ONE):
- ‚ùå Remove: `@hello-pangea/dnd` AND `react-beautiful-dnd`
- ‚úÖ Keep: `@dnd-kit/*` (most modern)

#### 2.2: Consolidate Login Components
**Current Duplicates**:
- `src/components/ui/organisms/login-form.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/organisms/login-form-new.tsx`
- `src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`

  "db:seed": "prisma db seed",
  "db:studio": "prisma studio",
  "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
  "clean": "rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache"
}
```

#### 3.3: Fix Next.js Configuration Conflicts
**Problem**: Both `next.config.js` and `next.config.mjs` exist
**Solution**: Standardize on single configuration file

#### 3.4: Remove Redundant Migration Scripts
**Current**: 20+ migration scripts
**Action**: Keep only essential migrations, remove development-only scripts

#### 3.5: Organize Component Structure
**Target Structure**:
```
