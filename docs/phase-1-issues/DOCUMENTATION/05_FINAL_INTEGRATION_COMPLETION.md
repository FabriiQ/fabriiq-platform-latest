## üìä **POINTS CALCULATION SYSTEM (UNIFIED)**

### **New Unified Logic:**
```typescript
// For graded activities: 1:1 mapping with grade percentage
const gradePercentage = Math.round((score / maxScore) * 100);
const basePoints = gradePercentage;

// For non-graded activities: Based on complexity
const basePoints = {
  'low': 10,
  'medium': 25,
  'high': 50
}[complexity];

// Apply purpose-based multipliers
const multiplier = {
  'ASSESSMENT': 1.5,
  'PRACTICE': 1.2,
  'ENRICHMENT': 1.1,
  'default': 1.0
}[purpose];

const totalPoints = Math.round(basePoints * multiplier);
```

### **Duplicate Prevention:**
- Check for existing points before awarding
- Atomic database transactions
- Comprehensive logging for audit trail
- Race condition prevention

---

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **1. Race Conditions in Points Award ‚úÖ**
- **Problem**: Multiple simultaneous submissions causing duplicate points
- **Solution**: Implemented atomic transactions with duplicate checks
- **Result**: Points are now awarded exactly once per activity completion

### **2. Memory Leaks in Grading Components ‚úÖ**
- **Problem**: Timer cleanup missing, large objects not garbage collected
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive cleanup in all components
- **Result**: Memory usage stable during long grading sessions

### **3. Inconsistent Points Calculations ‚úÖ**
- **Problem**: Multiple calculation systems with different logic
- **Solution**: Created single `UnifiedPointsService` with standardized logic
- **Result**: All activities now use consistent points calculation

### **4. UI Component Conflicts ‚úÖ**
- **Problem**: Multiple grading components with different implementations
- **Solution**: Standardized to use `UnifiedGradingComponent`
- **Result**: Consistent grading experience across all activity types

## üìã **REMAINING TEACHER PORTAL UPDATES NEEDED**

### **High Priority (Immediate):**
```
‚ùå src/app/teacher/classes/[classId]/activities/[activityId]/page.tsx
   - Needs StandardizedActivityConfig integration
   - Update activity viewer to use unified components

‚ùå src/app/teacher/classes/[classId]/activities/[activityId]/edit/page.tsx
