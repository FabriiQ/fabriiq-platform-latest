# Activity Status & Bloom Analytics - Verification Guide

## Part 1: Activity Status Update Fix

### Issue Summary
Student activities were not showing correct status (completed/in-progress) after submission due to cache invalidation problems and priority handling issues.

### Root Causes Identified & Fixed

#### 1. ❌ Missing Cache Invalidation (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: After activity submission, the frontend cache wasn't being invalidated for `activityGrade` queries.
**Solution**: Added proper cache invalidation in `useActivityOptimisticUpdates.ts`

```typescript
// BEFORE (Missing invalidations)
utils.activity.listByClass.invalidate();
utils.student.getClassActivities.invalidate();
utils.activity.getById.invalidate({ id: activityId });

// AFTER (Complete invalidations)
utils.activity.listByClass.invalidate();
utils.student.getClassActivities.invalidate();
utils.activity.getById.invalidate({ id: activityId });
utils.activityGrade.listByStudentAndClass.invalidate(); // ✅ ADDED
utils.activityGrade.get.invalidate({ activityId }); // ✅ ADDED
utils.activityGrade.invalidate(); // ✅ ADDED
```

#### 2. ❌ Priority Not Propagated
**Problem**: High priority (10) from submitButtonProps wasn't reaching the API, causing batch processing delays.
**Solution**: Added priority prop to ActivityInteractionWrapper and passed it through.

```typescript
// BEFORE (Hardcoded priority)
priority: 5, // High priority for faster processing

// AFTER (Dynamic priority)
priority: priority, // Use the priority prop passed from parent
```

#### 3. ❌ TypeScript Errors
**Problem**: Property access errors causing compilation issues.
**Solution**: Fixed property access and type conversions.

## Part 2: Bloom Analytics Creation & Verification

### How Bloom Analytics Work - Complete Data Flow

#### 1. 📊 Data Collection Phase
When students complete activities or assessments, the system captures Bloom's taxonomy data:

**Activity Completion:**
- Each activity has a `bloomsLevel` (single level) or `bloomsLevelScores` (multiple levels)
- When submitted, `ActivityGrade` is created with score and Bloom's level data
- `MasteryUpdateHandler` component automatically triggers mastery updates

**Assessment Completion:**
- Questions have individual `bloomsLevel` assignments
- Assessment results calculate scores per Bloom's level
- `AssessmentResult` stores `bloomsLevelScores` as JSON

#### 2. 🎯 Topic Mastery Calculation
The `MasteryCalculator` service processes each completion:

```typescript
// Core mastery calculation algorithm
export class MasteryCalculator {
  public static calculateMastery(
    currentMastery: TopicMasteryData | null,
    newResult: AssessmentResultData
  ): TopicMasteryData {
    // Apply decay to existing mastery (knowledge fading)
    const decayedMastery = this.applyDecay(currentMastery);

    // Update with new performance
    const updatedMastery = this.updateMasteryLevels(decayedMastery, newResult);

    // Calculate weighted overall mastery
    updatedMastery.overallMastery = this.calculateOverallMastery(updatedMastery);

    return updatedMastery;
  }
}
```

**TopicMastery Model Structure:**
```prisma
model TopicMastery {
  id                String   @id @default(cuid())
  studentId         String
  topicId           String
  subjectId         String
  rememberLevel     Float    @default(0)    // 0-100%
  understandLevel   Float    @default(0)    // 0-100%
  applyLevel        Float    @default(0)    // 0-100%
  analyzeLevel      Float    @default(0)    // 0-100%
  evaluateLevel     Float    @default(0)    // 0-100%
  createLevel       Float    @default(0)    // 0-100%
  overallMastery    Float    @default(0)    // Weighted average
  lastAssessmentDate DateTime
}
```

#### 3. 📈 Analytics Aggregation
The `BloomsAnalyticsService` aggregates individual masteries into class-level analytics:

**Student Performance Aggregation:**
- Averages topic masteries across all topics for each student
- Calculates overall mastery and Bloom's level breakdown per student

**Topic Performance Aggregation:**
- Averages student masteries for each topic
- Identifies mastery gaps and high-performing areas

**Class Performance Calculation:**
- Combines all student and topic data
- Generates distribution charts and heatmap data

#### 4. 🎨 Dashboard Visualization
Teacher dashboard displays analytics through multiple components:

**Overview Cards:**
- Average class mastery percentage
- Mastery distribution (Mastered/Partial/Not Mastered)
- Cognitive skills radar chart showing Bloom's levels

**Interactive Charts:**
- `BloomsCognitiveDistributionChart`: Bar chart of Bloom's level distribution
- `MasteryHeatmap`: Student vs Topic mastery visualization
- `MasteryRadarChart`: Cognitive skills across Bloom's taxonomy

**Analytics Tabs:**
- Overview: Class-level summary statistics
- Students: Individual student performance and heatmaps
- Assessments: Assessment-specific Bloom's analysis
- Mastery: Topic mastery tracking and trends
- Reports: Comprehensive analytics reports

```

### Key Database Models

**TopicMastery (Core Analytics Model):**
- Stores individual student mastery per topic
- Six Bloom's levels (0-100% each)
- Weighted overall mastery calculation
- Automatic decay for knowledge retention modeling

**ActivityGrade Integration:**
- Links to TopicMastery via `topicMasteryId`
- Stores `bloomsLevelScores` JSON for multi-level activities
- Triggers mastery updates on grade creation

**AssessmentResult Integration:**
- Calculates Bloom's scores from question-level data
- Updates TopicMastery through same pipeline
- Supports complex assessments with mixed cognitive levels

### Analytics Calculation Algorithms

**Mastery Decay Formula:**
```typescript
// Knowledge retention modeling
const decayFactor = Math.exp(-daysSinceLastAssessment / DECAY_HALF_LIFE);
const decayedMastery = currentMastery * decayFactor;
```

**Weighted Overall Mastery:**
```typescript
const BLOOMS_WEIGHTS = {
  REMEMBER: 1.0,    // Basic recall
  UNDERSTAND: 1.2,  // Comprehension
  APPLY: 1.5,       // Application
  ANALYZE: 2.0,     // Analysis
  EVALUATE: 2.5,    // Evaluation
  CREATE: 3.0       // Synthesis/Creation
};
```

**Class Performance Aggregation:**
- Student averages across all topics
- Topic averages across all students
- Distribution calculations for dashboard charts
- Mastery gap identification for interventions

## Status Mapping Logic

The system maps ActivityGrade.status to display status as follows:

```typescript
switch (grade.status) {
  case 'GRADED':
  case 'COMPLETED':
    status = 'completed'; // ✅ Green, "Completed"
    break;
  case 'SUBMITTED':
  case 'DRAFT':
    status = 'in-progress'; // ✅ Teal, "In Progress"
    break;
  case 'UNATTEMPTED':
    status = 'pending'; // ✅ Gray, "Not Started"
    break;
}
```

## Database Flow

### Activity Submission Process:
1. **Student submits** → `api.activity.submitActivity.useMutation()`
2. **Server processes** → `processActivitySubmission()` function
3. **ActivityGrade created/updated** → Status set to `GRADED` or `COMPLETED`
4. **Cache invalidated** → Frontend queries refreshed
5. **UI updates** → Status displayed correctly

### ActivityGrade Lifecycle:
```
UNATTEMPTED → SUBMITTED → GRADED/COMPLETED
    ↓             ↓            ↓
"Not Started" → "In Progress" → "Completed"
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/hooks/useActivityOptimisticUpdates.ts`**
   - Added activityGrade cache invalidations

2. **`src/components/activities/ActivityInteractionWrapper.tsx`**
   - Added priority prop and propagation

3. **`src/components/activities/DirectActivityViewer.tsx`**
   - Pass priority prop to wrapper

4. **`src/features/student-assistant/providers/student-assistant-provider.tsx`**
   - Fixed TypeScript property access errors

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ Immediate Status Updates
- Activity status changes instantly after submission
- No delay or "processing" states for high-priority submissions
- UI reflects database state accurately

### ✅ Consistent Cache State
- All browser tabs show the same status
- Refreshing pages shows correct status
- No stale cache issues

### ✅ Proper Score Display
- Scores appear immediately after grading
- Points are awarded correctly
- Achievements unlock as expected

### ✅ Responsive UI
- Status indicators (colors, icons) update correctly
- Action buttons change appropriately (Start → Continue → View Results)
- Progress tracking works accurately

## Troubleshooting

If status updates still don't work:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for API errors or cache issues
2. **Verify Priority**: Ensure priority ≥ 4 for immediate processing
3. **Check Database**: Verify ActivityGrade records are being created/updated
4. **Clear Cache**: Hard refresh browser or clear application cache
5. **Check Network**: Ensure API calls are completing successfully

## Performance Impact

The fixes have minimal performance impact:
- **Cache invalidation**: Necessary for data consistency
- **Priority processing**: Only affects high-priority submissions (student portal)
- **Type safety**: Prevents runtime errors

The system now provides immediate feedback while maintaining data integrity and performance.
