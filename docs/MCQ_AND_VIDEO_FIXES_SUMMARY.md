# Multiple Choice Question and Video Viewer Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Multiple Choice Question Selection Issue

**Problem**: Multiple choice options were showing hover effects but not being selected when clicked or touched.

**Root Cause**: The click event handler was not properly connected between the `SelectableOption` component and the parent's `handleAnswerSelect` function.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the prop naming from `onClick` to `onSelect` for clarity
- Added proper event handling with `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`
- Enhanced keyboard navigation support
- Added debugging logs to track selection

**Files Modified**:
- `src/features/activities-v2/components/quiz/question-viewers/MultipleChoiceQuestionViewer.tsx`
- `src/app/test-mcq/page.tsx` (test page with debugging)

### 2. Video Viewer Size Issue

**Problem**: Video viewers were too small in height, making it difficult to view video content properly.

**Root Cause**: Video containers were using default `aspect-video` class which created small video players.

**Solution**: 
- Increased minimum height from 300px to 400px
- Increased maximum height from 70vh to 80vh
- Applied consistent sizing across all video viewer components

**Files Modified**:
- `src/features/activities-v2/components/video/VideoViewer.tsx`
- `src/features/activties/components/video/VideoViewer.tsx`
- `src/features/activities-v2/components/quiz/question-viewers/VideoQuestionViewer.tsx`

## Technical Details

### Multiple Choice Fix

#### Before:
```typescript
// Broken event handling
const SelectableOption = ({ onClick }) => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    onClick(); // This wasn't being called properly
  };
  // ...
};
```

#### After:
```typescript
// Fixed event handling
const SelectableOption = ({ onSelect }) => {
  const handleClick = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    e.stopPropagation();
    
    if (showFeedback) return;
    
    // Animation and feedback
    if (optionRef.current) {
      optionRef.current.classList.add('pulse-animation');
      setTimeout(() => {
        optionRef.current?.classList.remove('pulse-animation');
      }, 500);
    }
    
    setIsTouched(true);
    onSelect(); // Properly calls the selection handler
  };
  // ...
};
```

### Video Viewer Fix

#### Before:
```typescript
// Small video container
<div className="aspect-video bg-black rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
```

#### After:
```typescript
// Larger video container
<div 
  className="bg-black rounded-lg overflow-hidden" 
  style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9', minHeight: '400px', maxHeight: '80vh' }}
>
```

## Testing
