# Current State Analysis: FabriiQ LXP Compliance Readiness

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the current FabriiQ Learning Experience Platform's compliance readiness against GDPR, PDPL, and FERPA requirements. The analysis is based on codebase review, database schema examination, and existing system architecture.

## Current System Architecture

### 🏗️ Authentication & Authorization

**Current Implementation:**
- NextAuth.js for authentication with JWT strategy
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with UserType enum
- Permission-based authorization middleware
- Session management with 7-day expiry
- Multi-campus access control

**Compliance Readiness:**
- ✅ Strong authentication foundation
- ✅ Granular permission system
- ✅ Session security measures
- ⚠️ Missing consent tracking in authentication flow
- ⚠️ No age verification for minors

### 📊 Data Storage & Management

**Current Database Schema:**
```sql
-- User data storage
User {
  id, name, email, username, phoneNumber, password
  dateOfBirth, profileData (JSON)
  userType, status, accessScope
  institutionId, primaryCampusId
  createdAt, updatedAt, lastLoginAt
}

-- Student profiles with sensitive data
StudentProfile {
  enrollmentNumber, currentGrade, academicHistory
  interests, achievements, specialNeeds
  guardianInfo (JSON), attendanceRate
  academicScore, participationRate
}

-- Teacher profiles with professional data
TeacherProfile {
  specialization, qualifications, certifications
  experience, expertise, publications
  teachingLoad, studentFeedbackScore
}
```

**Compliance Assessment:**
- ✅ Structured personal data storage
- ✅ Separation of sensitive data in profiles
- ✅ JSON fields for flexible data storage
- ⚠️ No explicit consent tracking fields
- ⚠️ No data retention metadata
- ⚠️ Missing data processing purpose fields

### 🔐 Security Measures

**Current Implementation:**
- Password hashing with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- HTTPS enforcement via middleware
- Role-based API access control
- File upload validation and sanitization
- Supabase storage with bucket-level permissions

**Security Features:**
```typescript
// Existing security middleware
export const protectedProcedure = t.procedure
  .use(errorHandlingMiddleware)
  .use(performanceMiddleware)
  .use(authenticationMiddleware);

// File upload security
const storageConfig = {
  maxFileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB
  allowedMimeTypes: ['image/*', 'video/*'],
  bucketConfigs: {
    socialWall: { public: true },
    documents: { public: false },
    assessments: { public: false }
  }
};
```

**Compliance Assessment:**
- ✅ Strong encryption in transit
- ✅ Secure file handling
- ✅ Access control implementation
- ⚠️ No encryption at rest documentation
- ⚠️ Missing data anonymization features
- ⚠️ No secure deletion procedures

### 📝 Audit & Logging

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
// Basic audit logging exists
model AuditLog {
  id, userId, campusId, entityType, entityId
  action, changes (JSON), metadata (JSON)
  createdAt
}

// Analytics tracking
model AnalyticsEvent {
  event, userId, institutionId, campusId
  data (JSON), timestamp
}
```

**Compliance Assessment:**
- ✅ Basic audit trail infrastructure
- ✅ User action tracking
- ✅ Change logging capability
- ⚠️ Incomplete data access logging
- ⚠️ No consent change tracking
- ⚠️ Missing data export/deletion logs

### 👥 User Rights Management
