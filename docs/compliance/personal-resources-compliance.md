# Personal Resources Storage Compliance

## Overview

This document outlines the compliance measures implemented for personal educational resources storage in accordance with GDPR, PDPL, and FERPA regulations.

## Compliance Standards

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **Article 5**: Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
- **Article 6**: Lawful basis for processing
- **Article 17**: Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")
- **Article 20**: Right to data portability
- **Article 25**: Data protection by design and by default
- **Article 30**: Records of processing activities
- **Article 32**: Security of processing

### PDPL (Personal Data Protection Law)
- Personal data protection requirements
- Consent management
- Data subject rights
- Security safeguards

### FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)
- Educational records protection
- Student privacy rights
- Data retention requirements (7 years)
- Secure access controls

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Architecture

```
personal-resources/
├── {user-id}/
│   ├── personal/
│   │   ├── documents/
│   │   ├── images/
│   │   └── media/
│   └── shared/
│       ├── class-resources/
│       └── subject-resources/
```

### Security Features

1. **Private Bucket Storage**
   - All personal resources stored in private Supabase bucket
   - No public access allowed
   - User-specific folder isolation

2. **Access Control**
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - User can only access their own resources
   - Signed URLs for temporary access

3. **Encryption**
   - AES-256 encryption at rest
   - TLS 1.3 encryption in transit
   - Encrypted audit logs

4. **Audit Logging**
   - All operations logged for compliance
   - Immutable audit trail
   - Structured logging with metadata

### Data Retention

#### FERPA Compliance
- **Educational Records**: 7 years retention
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Configurable auto-deletion
- **Manual Override**: Users can delete earlier

#### GDPR Right to be Forgotten
- **Immediate Deletion**: User-requested deletion
- **Complete Removal**: All copies and backups
- **Audit Trail**: Deletion events logged

### Compliance Features

#### 1. Data Minimization
```typescript
// Only collect necessary metadata
metadata: {
  userId: string,
  uploadedAt: Date,
  mimeType: string,
  retentionPeriod: string,
  complianceFlags: ['GDPR', 'PDPL', 'FERPA']
}
```

#### 2. Purpose Limitation
- Resources used only for educational purposes
- Clear data processing purposes documented
- No secondary use without consent

#### 3. Storage Limitation
- Automatic retention period enforcement
- Regular cleanup of expired data
- User notification before deletion

#### 4. Accuracy
- Users can update/correct their resources
- Version control for document changes
- Metadata accuracy validation

#### 5. Integrity and Confidentiality
- Checksums for file integrity
- Private storage with access controls
- Encrypted transmission and storage

## API Compliance Features

### Upload Endpoint
```typescript
POST /api/trpc/resource.uploadFile
- Compliance-aware storage selection
- Automatic metadata tagging
- Audit logging
- Retention period calculation
```

### Access Control
```typescript
GET /api/trpc/resource.getSecureUrl
- User ownership verification
- Signed URL generation
- Access logging
- Time-limited access
```

### Data Deletion
```typescript
DELETE /api/trpc/resource.deletePersonalResource
- GDPR right to be forgotten
- Complete data removal
- Audit trail maintenance
- Compliance verification
```

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Audit Log Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE personal_resource_audit_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  action TEXT NOT NULL,
  resource_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  metadata JSONB,
  compliance_standards TEXT[]
);
```

### Compliance Metrics
- Upload/download activity
- Retention policy adherence
- Deletion request processing
- Access pattern analysis

## User Rights Implementation

### GDPR Article 15: Right of Access
- Users can list all their resources
- Metadata and processing information available
- Export functionality for data portability

### GDPR Article 16: Right to Rectification
- Users can update resource metadata
- File replacement capabilities
- Change tracking and versioning

### GDPR Article 17: Right to Erasure
- One-click deletion of personal resources
- Complete removal from all systems
- Deletion confirmation and audit trail

### GDPR Article 20: Right to Data Portability
- Export all personal resources
- Structured data format (JSON/ZIP)
- Includes metadata and audit logs

## Compliance Procedures

### Data Breach Response
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts
2. **Assessment**: Impact evaluation within 24 hours
3. **Notification**: Authorities within 72 hours if required
4. **User Communication**: Direct notification if high risk
5. **Remediation**: Immediate security measures

### Regular Compliance Reviews
- **Monthly**: Audit log analysis
- **Quarterly**: Retention policy review
- **Annually**: Full compliance assessment
- **Ad-hoc**: Regulation updates integration

### Staff Training
- GDPR/PDPL/FERPA awareness training
- Technical implementation understanding
- Incident response procedures
- Regular updates on regulation changes
