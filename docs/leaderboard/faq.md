# Leaderboard System Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is the leaderboard system?

The leaderboard system is a feature that displays student rankings based on points earned through various activities. It provides a motivational tool to encourage student engagement and achievement by showing their relative performance compared to peers.

### Who can access the leaderboard?

The leaderboard is accessible to:
- **Students**: Can view their own ranking and the rankings of their classmates
- **Teachers**: Can view and manage leaderboards for their classes
- **Coordinators**: Can view aggregated leaderboards across multiple courses and classes
- **Administrators**: Have full access to all leaderboard data and settings

### How are rankings calculated?

Rankings are calculated based on the total points earned by students within a specific context (class, subject, or campus) and time period (daily, weekly, monthly, term, or all-time). The student with the highest points is ranked #1, the second-highest is ranked #2, and so on.

In case of a tie (students with equal points), the following tiebreakers are applied in order:
1. Completion rate (percentage of assigned activities completed)
2. Academic score (if available)
3. Most recent point earned (favoring the student who earned points most recently)

### What time periods are available for the leaderboard?

The leaderboard supports the following time periods:
- **Daily**: Points earned in the current day
- **Weekly**: Points earned in the current week (Monday to Sunday)
- **Monthly**: Points earned in the current calendar month
- **Term**: Points earned in the current academic term
- **All-Time**: All points earned since the beginning
