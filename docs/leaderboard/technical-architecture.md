# Leaderboard System Technical Architecture

## Overview

The leaderboard system is designed to provide a scalable, efficient, and flexible way to track and display student rankings across different contexts (classes, subjects, campuses) and time periods. The architecture follows a modular approach with clear separation of concerns to ensure maintainability and extensibility.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Data Layer

#### Database Schema

The leaderboard system relies on the following key database models:

- **LeaderboardEntry**: Represents a single entry in a leaderboard
  - Contains student information, points, rank, and metadata
  - Linked to specific contexts (class, subject, campus)

- **LeaderboardSnapshot**: Point-in-time captures of leaderboard states
  - Used for historical tracking and performance optimization
  - Enables time-based comparisons and trend analysis

- **PointsTransaction**: Records individual point-earning events
  - Provides audit trail for all point changes
  - Supports transparency features

#### Partitioning Strategy

The leaderboard implements a sophisticated partitioning strategy:

- **Entity-based partitioning**: Separate leaderboards for classes, subjects, and campuses
- **Time-based partitioning**: Daily, weekly, monthly, term, and all-time periods
- **Demographic partitioning**: Optional grouping by student characteristics
- **Custom group partitioning**: User-defined groupings for specialized comparisons

### 2. Service Layer

The service layer provides the business logic for leaderboard operations:

- **LeaderboardService**: Core service for basic leaderboard operations
- **OptimizedLeaderboardService**: Performance-optimized implementation with caching
- **LeaderboardPartitioningService**: Handles creation and management of partitioned views
- **BackgroundProcessingService**: Manages asynchronous processing of heavy operations

### 3. API Layer

The API layer exposes leaderboard functionality to the frontend:

- **LeaderboardRouter**: Provides REST endpoints for leaderboard operations
- **WebSocket Service**: Enables real-time updates for leaderboard changes
- **GraphQL Schema**: Optional GraphQL interface for flexible data fetching

### 4. UI Components

The UI layer is built with React components organized by functionality:

- **Core Components**: Base display components (BaseLeaderboardTable)
- **Extended Components**: Enhanced functionality (VirtualizedLeaderboardTable)
- **Composite Components**: Combinations of components (ResponsiveLeaderboard)
- **Specialized Components**: Context-specific implementations (ClassLeaderboard)

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Optimizations

- **Indexed queries**: Optimized database indexes for common query patterns
- **Materialized views**: Pre-computed aggregations for faster retrieval
- **Batch processing**: Background processing of heavy calculations
- **Caching layer**: Multi-level caching strategy for frequently accessed data

### Frontend Optimizations

- **Virtualized lists**: Efficient rendering of large datasets
- **Progressive loading**: Priority-based loading of UI components
- **Code splitting**: Dynamic imports for optimized bundle sizes
- **Responsive design**: Optimized layouts for different device types
- **Battery-efficient updates**: Adaptive update strategies based on device state

## Security Considerations

- **Role-based access control**: Permissions based on user roles
- **Data validation**: Input validation at API boundaries
- **Rate limiting**: Protection against excessive API usage
- **Audit logging**: Tracking of significant system events
- **Anti-gaming measures**: Detection and prevention of system manipulation

## Integration Points

- **Authentication system**: User identity and role information
- **Points system**: Source of points data for rankings
- **Notification system**: Alerts for significant leaderboard events
- **Analytics system**: Data for performance insights
- **Student profile system**: Enriched student information

## Deployment Architecture

- **Containerized services**: Docker-based deployment
- **Horizontal scaling**: Support for multiple service instances
- **Database replication**: Read replicas for query performance
- **CDN integration**: Static asset delivery optimization
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana dashboards for system health

## Development Workflow

- **Feature branches**: Isolated development of new features
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Feature flags**: Controlled rollout of new functionality
- **A/B testing**: Experimental features with metrics collection
- **Performance benchmarking**: Regular performance testing

## Future Extensibility

The architecture is designed to support future enhancements:

- **AI-powered insights**: Machine learning for pattern recognition
- **Gamification extensions**: Additional game mechanics beyond points
- **External integrations**: APIs for third-party system integration
- **Advanced analytics**: Deeper insights into student performance
- **Personalization**: Tailored leaderboard experiences
