# Teacher Assistant V2 - Issue Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ TypeScript Errors in Search Tools
**Problem:** The `tool` function from AI SDK v5 was not properly configured, causing TypeScript errors.

**Solution:** 
- Fixed the tool definitions in `src/features/teacher-assistant-v2/lib/ai/search-tools.ts`
- Changed `parameters` to `inputSchema` to match AI SDK v5 syntax
- Removed explicit type annotations that were causing conflicts
- All three tools now properly defined: `webSearchTool`, `imageSearchTool`, `comprehensiveSearchTool`

### 2. ✅ Generate Worksheet Button Not Working
**Problem:** No dedicated "Generate Worksheet" button was available in the interface.

**Solution:**
- Created new `QuickActions` component (`src/features/teacher-assistant-v2/components/quick-actions.tsx`)
- Added 6 quick action buttons including "Generate Worksheet"
- Integrated quick actions into the chat interface
- Quick actions appear when conversation is empty to guide users
- Each action triggers a specific, optimized prompt for content generation

### 3. ✅ Images Not Being Included in Worksheets
**Problem:** Generated worksheets didn't include images despite search tools being available.

**Solution:**
- **Enabled search tools** in the router (`src/features/teacher-assistant-v2/server/router.ts`)
- **Enhanced system prompt** to emphasize image inclusion in educational content
- **Updated worksheet prompts** to specifically request image searches
- **Added comprehensive search strategy** for visual content integration

## New Features Added

### Quick Actions Component
- **Generate Worksheet**: Creates comprehensive worksheets with images
- **Lesson Plan**: Generates detailed lesson plans with visual aids
- **Assessment**: Creates quizzes and tests with visual elements
- **Learning Activity**: Designs engaging classroom activities
- **Visual Content**: Focuses on diagram and image-heavy content
- **Math Problems**: Generates math problems with visual representations

### Enhanced AI Integration
- Search tools now properly integrated with AI responses
- Proactive image searching for educational content
- Better visual content integration in generated materials
- Improved educational prompting for comprehensive content creation

## Files Modified

### Core Fixes
1. `src/features/teacher-assistant-v2/lib/ai/search-tools.ts` - Fixed TypeScript errors
2. `src/features/teacher-assistant-v2/server/router.ts` - Enabled search tools
3. `src/features/teacher-assistant-v2/lib/ai/providers.ts` - Enhanced system prompt

### New Components
4. `src/features/teacher-assistant-v2/components/quick-actions.tsx` - Quick action buttons
5. `src/features/teacher-assistant-v2/components/chat.tsx` - Integrated quick actions

### Testing
6. `scripts/test-teacher-assistant-v2.js` - Test script for functionality
7. `package.json` - Added test script

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Run the Test Suite
```bash
npm run test:teacher-assistant-v2
```

### 2. Manual Testing
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the Teacher Assistant V2 interface
3. Look for the "Quick Actions" panel when starting a new conversation
4. Click "Generate Worksheet" button
5. Verify that the generated worksheet includes:
   - Clear structure with title, instructions, questions
   - Relevant images and visual aids
   - Answer key
   - Proper markdown formatting

### 3. Test Image Integration
1. Ask for a worksheet on a specific topic (e.g., "Create a worksheet about the solar system")
2. Verify that the AI searches for and includes relevant images
3. Check that images have proper markdown syntax: `![Alt text](image_url)`
4. Ensure images are contextually relevant to the content

## Expected Behavior

### Worksheet Generation
- ✅ Quick action button triggers worksheet creation
- ✅ AI searches for relevant images automatically
- ✅ Generated content includes visual elements
- ✅ Proper markdown formatting with embedded images
- ✅ Comprehensive structure with all necessary sections

### Search Integration
- ✅ Web search for educational resources
- ✅ Image search for visual aids
- ✅ Comprehensive search combining both
- ✅ Natural integration of search results into responses

## Troubleshooting

### If Images Still Don't Appear
1. Check that `JINA_API_KEY` is set in environment variables
2. Verify that search tools are enabled in the router
3. Ensure the AI model has access to the search tools
4. Check browser console for any API errors

### If Quick Actions Don't Work
1. Verify the QuickActions component is properly imported
2. Check that the chat component includes the quick actions
3. Ensure the handleQuickAction function is properly connected

### If TypeScript Errors Persist
1. Restart the TypeScript server in your IDE
2. Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. Check that all imports are correct

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** with different subjects and grade levels
2. **Monitor image quality** and relevance in generated content
3. **Gather user feedback** on the quick actions functionality
4. **Consider adding more specialized quick actions** based on usage patterns
5. **Implement proper error handling** for search API failures
