   - Optimize API responses for mobile devices (limit payload size)

2. **State Management**
   - Use React Context for global state
   - Implement local component state for UI-specific state
   - Use URL state for shareable views

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Cache API responses for faster subsequent loads
   - Implement optimistic updates for better UX
   - Use service workers for offline capabilities

     size = 24,
     strokeWidth = 2,
     ...props
   }) => {
     return (
       <svg
         xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
         width={size}
         height={size}
         viewBox="0 0 24 24"

       </svg>
     );
   };
   ```

2. **Custom Date Functions**
   ```tsx
   // Custom date-fns functions implementation
   const startOfMonth = (date: Date): Date => {
     return new Date(date.getFullYear(), date.getMonth(), 1);
   };

   const endOfMonth = (date: Date): Date => {
     return new Date(date.getFullYear(), date.getMonth() + 1, 0);
   };

   const isSameMonth = (dateLeft: Date, dateRight: Date): boolean => {
     return (
       dateLeft.getFullYear() === dateRight.getFullYear() &&
       dateLeft.getMonth() === dateRight.getMonth()
     );
   };
   ```

3. **TypeScript Type Assertions**
   ```tsx
   // Example of type assertions for string literals
   const upcomingActivities = [
     {
       id: '1',
       title: 'Mathematics Quiz',
       subject: 'Mathematics',
       dueDate: new Date(Date.now() + 86400000), // Tomorrow
       status: 'upcoming' as const, // Type assertion for union type
       type: 'Quiz'
     },
     // More activities...
   ];

   // Example of type assertions for question types
   const questions = [
     {
       id: 'q1',
       question: 'What is the formula for the area of a circle?',
       type: 'multiple-choice' as const, // Type assertion for union type
       options: ['πr²', '2πr', 'πd', '2πr²'],
       correctAnswer: 'πr²',
       points: 5
     },
     // More questions...
   ];
   ```

## Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### TypeScript Integration

During implementation, we encountered several TypeScript-related challenges that required solutions:

1. **Missing Lucide Icons**
   - **Challenge**: Several Lucide icons used in components were not exported from the library
   - **Solution**: Created custom icon components in `src/components/shared/entities/students/icons.tsx` for missing icons like `ChevronLeft`, `PieChart`, `BookMarked`, `Share2`, `Send`, and `Info`

2. **Date-fns Compatibility**
   - **Challenge**: Some date-fns functions used in the calendar component were not available
   - **Solution**: Implemented custom versions of missing functions like `startOfMonth`, `endOfMonth`, and `isSameMonth`

3. **Type Assertions**
   - **Challenge**: String literals needed to match specific union types
   - **Solution**: Added `as const` type assertions to ensure type safety

4. **Schema Compatibility**
   - **Challenge**: Database schema might not include all required fields
   - **Solution**: Used conditional logic and fallback values to handle missing data

### Performance Optimizations Implemented

1. **Efficient Rendering**
   - Implemented conditional rendering to avoid unnecessary component updates
   - Used skeleton loading states for better perceived performance

2. **State Management**
   - Localized state to components when possible
   - Used controlled forms with debounced inputs for search and filtering
