# UX Writing Guidelines

## Introduction

This document outlines our approach to UX writing across all digital products. Good UX writing creates clear, concise, and helpful text that guides users through their journey while reflecting our brand personality. These guidelines ensure consistency in our communication and help build trust with our users.

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Our Voice (Who We Are)

Our voice is the consistent personality that comes through in all our communications. It remains constant regardless of context.

**Our voice is:**

- **Knowledgeable**: We demonstrate expertise without being condescending
- **Supportive**: We're here to help users succeed
- **Clear**: We communicate directly and avoid unnecessary complexity
- **Professional**: We maintain credibility while being approachable
- **Empathetic**: We understand our users' needs and challenges

### Our Tone (How We Speak)

While our voice remains consistent, our tone adapts to different contexts and user emotions. Tone is how we express our voice in specific situations.

#### Tone Spectrum

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Success states** | Celebratory, encouraging | "Great job! Your class has been created successfully." |
| **Neutral states** | Straightforward, helpful | "Select a subject to continue with your lesson plan." |
| **Error states** | Empathetic, solution-oriented | "We couldn't save your changes. Try again or refresh the page to continue." |
| **Onboarding** | Welcoming, guiding | "Welcome to your dashboard. Here's where you'll manage your classes and activities." |
| **Technical features** | Clear, instructional | "Use the class selector to quickly switch between different groups of students." |

## Writing Principles

### 1. Be Clear and Concise

- Use simple, direct language that users can understand immediately
- Avoid jargon, technical terms, and acronyms unless necessary (and if used, explain them)
- Keep sentences short and to the point
- Use active voice whenever possible

**Example:**
❌ "The system was unable to process your request due to validation errors in the submitted form."  
✅ "Please fix the highlighted fields to save your form."

### 2. Be Helpful and Informative

- Anticipate user questions and answer them proactively
- Provide context for actions and decisions
- Explain what's happening and why it matters
- Guide users toward their next steps

**Example:**
❌ "Error 404"  
✅ "We can't find the page you're looking for. Return to dashboard or try searching for what you need."

### 3. Be Consistent

- Use the same terms for the same concepts throughout the product
- Maintain consistent capitalization, punctuation, and formatting
- Follow established patterns for similar UI elements
- Align with our brand voice in all communications

**Example:**
❌ Mixing "Class" and "Group" to refer to the same concept  
✅ Consistently using "Class" throughout the product

### 4. Be Human and Empathetic

- Write as if you're speaking to a real person
- Show understanding of user goals and pain points
- Use a conversational, natural tone
- Include appropriate warmth and personality

**Example:**
❌ "Input validation failed. Retry submission."  
✅ "Looks like some information is missing. Please fill in the required fields and try again."

### 5. Be Inclusive and Respectful

- Use inclusive, gender-neutral language
- Avoid idioms or cultural references that may not translate globally
- Consider accessibility in all writing
- Respect users' time, attention, and intelligence

**Example:**
❌ "Each teacher should update his profile."  
✅ "Teachers should update their profiles."

## UX Writing by Context

### Buttons and CTAs

Buttons should be clear about what will happen when clicked. Use action verbs that describe what the button does.

**Guidelines:**
- Use 1-3 words when possible
- Start with a verb for primary actions
- Be specific about the action
- Use sentence case (capitalize first word only)

**Examples:**
- "Create class"
- "Save changes"
- "Add student"
- "View details"

### Form Fields and Labels

Labels should clearly describe what information is needed. Help text should provide additional context when necessary.

**Guidelines:**
- Use clear, concise labels
- Indicate required fields
- Provide specific error messages
- Include helpful placeholder text when appropriate

**Examples:**
- Label: "Email address" (required)
- Placeholder: "name@school.edu"
- Help text: "We'll use this email to send class notifications"
- Error: "Please enter a valid school email address"

### Error Messages

Error messages should explain what went wrong and how to fix it. They should be helpful, not punitive.

**Guidelines:**
- Clearly state what happened
- Explain why it happened (if helpful)
- Tell users how to fix the problem
- Use empathetic language
- Avoid technical jargon

**Examples:**
- "We couldn't connect to the server. Check your internet connection and try again."
- "This email is already registered. Try signing in or use a different email."
- "Your session has expired. Please sign in again to continue."

### Empty States

Empty states are opportunities to guide users and explain what they can do next.

**Guidelines:**
- Explain why the screen is empty
- Provide clear next steps
- Use encouraging language
- Consider adding helpful visuals

**Examples:**
- "No activities yet. Create your first activity to get started."
- "Your student list is empty. Add students to begin tracking their progress."
- "No assignments due this week. Enjoy the break or plan ahead for next week."

### Confirmation Messages

Confirmations should reassure users that their action was successful and explain what happens next.

**Guidelines:**
- Confirm the action was completed
- Explain any follow-up steps
- Keep it brief but informative
- Use positive, affirming language

**Examples:**
- "Class created successfully. You can now add students or create activities."
- "Email sent to 24 parents. You'll be notified when they respond."
- "Changes saved. Your updates will be visible to students the next time they log in."

### Tooltips and Help Text

Tooltips provide additional context without cluttering the interface. They should be concise and helpful.

**Guidelines:**
- Keep tooltips under 140 characters
- Focus on one key piece of information
- Use to explain unfamiliar features
- Don't hide critical information in tooltips

**Examples:**
- "Set a due date to automatically notify students and track completion."
- "Customize visibility settings to control who can see this content."
- "Quick grade allows you to assess all submissions from a single view."

## Educational Context Considerations

As an educational platform, our writing should reflect the needs and expectations of educators, students, and administrators.

### For Teachers

- **Be respectful of their expertise**: Avoid overly prescriptive language
- **Acknowledge time constraints**: Emphasize efficiency and time-saving features
- **Support classroom management**: Provide clear guidance on administrative tasks
- **Enable effective teaching**: Focus on how features enhance educational outcomes

**Examples:**
- "Quickly assess student understanding with these ready-to-use formative assessments."
- "Save time by reusing activities from your library or exploring our curated collections."
- "Track progress at a glance with the new student dashboard."

### For Students

- **Be encouraging**: Use positive, motivational language
- **Be clear**: Provide straightforward instructions
- **Be age-appropriate**: Adjust complexity based on grade level
- **Be supportive**: Focus on learning and growth

**Examples:**
- "Great job completing your assignment! Here's what to work on next."
- "Need help? Here are resources to guide you through this activity."
- "Track your progress and see how far you've come this term."

### For Administrators

- **Be data-focused**: Emphasize insights and analytics
- **Be efficient**: Highlight time-saving and organizational features
- **Be comprehensive**: Provide complete information for decision-making
- **Be security-conscious**: Address privacy and data protection

**Examples:**
- "Get a complete overview of student performance across all classes."
- "Quickly identify trends and areas needing attention with our analytics dashboard."
- "Securely manage user permissions and access controls in one place."

## Humor and Personality

Appropriate humor can make our product more engaging and human, but should be used thoughtfully.

### When to Use Humor

- Success states and positive moments
- Low-stakes situations
- Moments of delight or surprise
- Loading screens or wait times

### When to Avoid Humor

- Error messages and frustrating situations
- Critical workflows and important decisions
- Security or privacy contexts
- Sensitive educational content

### Guidelines for Humor

- Keep it subtle and understated
- Ensure it's inclusive and universally understood
- Never use humor at the user's expense
- Test humor with actual users before implementing

**Examples of Appropriate Humor:**
- "High five! You've completed all your grading for the week."
- "Taking a moment to gather all your students' brilliant work..."
- "You're on a roll! That's 5 activities created today."

## Grammar and Mechanics

### Capitalization

- Use sentence case for headings, buttons, and labels (capitalize first word only)
- Capitalize proper nouns and product names
- Don't use all caps except for established acronyms

### Punctuation

- Use periods at the end of complete sentences, including in tooltips and help text
- Don't use periods for labels, headings, or button text
- Use serial commas (Oxford commas)
- Use single spaces after periods
- Use exclamation points sparingly and never in error messages

### Numbers

- Spell out numbers zero through nine, use numerals for 10 and above
- Use numerals for all measurements, percentages, and scores
- Use numerals when referring to specific interface elements (e.g., "Step 2")

### Dates and Times

- Use the format "Month Day, Year" (e.g., "January 15, 2025")
- Use 12-hour clock with AM/PM (e.g., "3:30 PM")
- Spell out days of the week and months

### Abbreviations

- Spell out terms on first use, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses
- Use common abbreviations only when space is limited
- Avoid creating new abbreviations

## Content Testing and Iteration

UX writing should be tested with real users and refined based on feedback.

### Testing Methods

- **Comprehension testing**: Do users understand what we're trying to communicate?
- **Preference testing**: Which version of copy do users prefer and why?
- **Task completion**: Does our copy help users complete tasks successfully?
- **A/B testing**: Which version performs better in real-world use?

### Iteration Process

1. Draft initial copy based on these guidelines
2. Review with product and design teams
3. Test with users
4. Refine based on feedback
5. Implement and monitor
6. Continue to gather feedback and improve

## Examples by User Emotion

### Happy/Satisfied

When users are in a positive emotional state, we can be more conversational and celebratory.

**Examples:**
- "Excellent work! Your class is all set up and ready for students."
- "You've completed all your tasks for today. Enjoy the rest of your day!"
- "Great job creating your first lesson plan. Your students are going to love it!"

### Neutral/Focused

When users are in a neutral state or focused on a task, we should be clear and straightforward.

**Examples:**
- "Select a subject to continue."
- "Add students to your class by uploading a CSV file or entering information manually."
- "Review your changes before publishing to students."

### Frustrated/Confused

When users might be frustrated or confused, we should be empathetic and solution-oriented.

**Examples:**
- "We know this is frustrating. Let's try a different approach to solve this."
- "It looks like something went wrong. Here are some steps that might help."
- "We couldn't find what you're looking for. Try these suggestions or contact support for help."

### Curious/Learning

When users are exploring or learning new features, we should be informative and encouraging.

**Examples:**
- "Wondering what this does? The activity generator creates customized learning materials based on your curriculum."
- "Try our new assessment tool to quickly gauge student understanding."
- "Discover how other teachers are using this feature to improve student engagement."

### Uncertain/Hesitant

When users are uncertain about proceeding, we should be reassuring and informative.

**Examples:**
- "Don't worry, you can always edit this later."
- "Your work is automatically saved as you go."
- "This information is only visible to you and won't be shared with students."
