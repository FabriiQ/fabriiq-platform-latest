# Fee Management Settings - Inconsistencies Review & Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Duplicate Configuration Sections** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Multiple overlapping late fee configuration sections created confusion
- Basic "Due Date Settings" in main page
- Advanced "Late Fee Settings" component  
- Both configured similar settings with different interfaces

**Solution:** Consolidated into a single, hierarchical interface:
- **Due Date Configuration**: Basic settings (due days, grace period, enable/disable)
- **Advanced Late Fee Settings**: Detailed configuration (amounts, types, limits)
- **Late Fee Policies**: Advanced policy management with assignment rules

### 2. **Conflicting Grace Period Settings** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** 
- Due Date Settings showed "Grace Period: 10 days"
- Late Fee Settings showed "Grace Period: 7 days"
- No clear precedence indication

**Solution:** 
- Separated concerns: Due Date settings for basic grace period
- Advanced settings for policy-specific grace periods
- Clear visual hierarchy and explanations

### 3. **Currency Symbol Inconsistency** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- Due Date Settings showed "₨" (Pakistani Rupee)
- Late Fee Settings showed "$" (US Dollar)
- No connection to selected currency settings

**Solution:**
- Integrated currency settings API call
- Dynamic currency symbol usage throughout all components
- Consistent display: `{currencySymbol}50` instead of hardcoded `$50`

### 4. **Policy Selection Mechanism Unclear** ✅ IMPROVED
**Problem:** 
- 6 policies shown but no explanation of selection mechanism
- Unclear if automatic or manual assignment
- No priority order indication

**Solution:**
- Added clear badge: "Policy Selection: Manual Assignment"
- Added explanation box: "Late fee policies must be manually assigned to specific fee types, programs, or classes"
- Added assignment button in policy table (placeholder for future implementation)
- Clear documentation of policy application rules

### 5. **Redundant Save Buttons** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Multiple save buttons for overlapping functionality

**Solution:**
- Separated save actions by functional area
- Clear labeling: "Save Due Date Settings", "Save Settings" (for advanced)
- Logical grouping of related settings

### 6. **Mock Data Issues** ✅ ADDRESSED
**Problem:** Policy table showed test data and placeholder policies

**Solution:**
- Connected to real API endpoints
- Proper loading states
- Empty state handling with clear call-to-action
