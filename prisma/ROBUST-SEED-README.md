## Troubleshooting

### If the seed fails:
1. Check your database connection
2. Ensure Prisma schema is up to date
3. Run `npx prisma generate` to update the client
4. Check for any pending migrations

### To re-run the seed:
The script uses `upsert` operations, so it's safe to run multiple times. It will update existing records rather than create duplicates.

### To clean the database:
If you need to start fresh, you can reset your database and run the seed again.

## Next Steps

After running the seed:
1. Test login with the admin account
2. Verify that all relationships are working
3. Add additional users, classes, or subjects as needed
4. Configure any additional settings specific to your institution

## Support

If you encounter any issues with the seeding process, check the console output for detailed error messages and ensure all prerequisites are met.
