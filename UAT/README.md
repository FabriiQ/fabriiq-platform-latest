## Purpose

The UAT documentation serves the following purposes:

1. **Validation**: Ensure that the system meets the business requirements and user expectations
2. **Acceptance**: Provide a basis for formal acceptance of the system by stakeholders
3. **Documentation**: Document the expected behavior of the system for future reference
4. **Training**: Serve as a basis for training materials for end users

## How to Use This Documentation

1. Start with the Test Plan for the relevant portal to understand the overall testing approach
2. Review the UAT Scenarios to understand the user journeys that will be tested
3. Use the UAT Test Cases for detailed step-by-step testing procedures

## UAT Process

1. **Preparation**: Review the test plan and scenarios
2. **Execution**: Follow the test cases step by step
3. **Documentation**: Record the results of each test case
4. **Issue Reporting**: Report any issues found during testing
5. **Retesting**: Retest any issues that have been fixed
6. **Sign-off**: Formally accept the system once all tests have passed
