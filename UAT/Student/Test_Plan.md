- Learning time tracking
- Commitment tracking system
- Mobile-first design
- Offline functionality

### 1.3 References
- System requirements documentation
- Student Portal design specifications
- API documentation
- Database schema
- UX psychology principles documentation

## 2. Test Approach

### 2.1 Testing Methodology
- **Feature-based testing**: Each major feature will be tested independently
- **End-to-end testing**: Complete user journeys will be tested from start to finish
- **Mobile and desktop testing**: All features will be tested on both mobile and desktop interfaces
- **Offline testing**: Features will be tested in offline mode to verify functionality
- **UX psychology testing**: Features will be tested against UX psychology principles
- **Performance testing**: Real-time data capabilities will be tested for performance

### 2.2 Entry Criteria
- All development work for the Student Portal is complete
- All critical bugs identified in previous testing phases have been fixed
- Test environment is set up and stable
