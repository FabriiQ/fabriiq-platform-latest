# Coordinator Portal UAT Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This test plan outlines the approach for User Acceptance Testing (UAT) of the Coordinator Portal in the Learning Experience Platform (LXP). It defines the testing scope, methodology, resources, and schedule to ensure the Coordinator Portal meets business requirements and user expectations.

### 1.2 Scope
The UAT will cover all key functionalities of the Coordinator Portal, including:
- Dashboard and analytics
- Teacher management and leaderboards
- Student management and leaderboards
- Course-wise analytics
- Class management
- Offline functionality
- Mobile-first design

### 1.3 References
- System requirements documentation
- Coordinator Portal design specifications
- API documentation
- Database schema

## 2. Test Approach

### 2.1 Testing Methodology
- **Feature-based testing**: Each major feature will be tested independently
- **End-to-end testing**: Complete user journeys will be tested from start to finish
- **Mobile and desktop testing**: All features will be tested on both mobile and desktop interfaces
- **Offline testing**: Features will be tested in offline mode to verify functionality
- **Performance testing**: Real-time data capabilities will be tested for performance

### 2.2 Entry Criteria
- All development work for the Coordinator Portal is complete
- All critical bugs identified in previous testing phases have been fixed
- Test environment is set up and stable
- Test data is prepared and available
- UAT test cases are reviewed and approved

### 2.3 Exit Criteria
- All planned test cases have been executed
- No critical or high-severity defects remain open
- All business requirements have been verified
- Stakeholders have signed off on the UAT results

## 3. Test Environment

### 3.1 Hardware Requirements
