- Fee and enrollment management
- Reporting and analytics

### 1.3 References
- System requirements documentation
- Admin Portal design specifications
- API documentation
- Database schema

## 2. Test Approach

### 2.1 Testing Methodology
- **Role-based testing**: Tests will be conducted from the perspective of different admin roles (System Admin, Campus Admin)
- **Feature-based testing**: Each major feature will be tested independently
- **End-to-end testing**: Complete user journeys will be tested from start to finish
- **Mobile and desktop testing**: All features will be tested on both mobile and desktop interfaces

### 2.2 Entry Criteria
- All development work for the Admin Portal is complete
- All critical bugs identified in previous testing phases have been fixed
- Test environment is set up and stable
- Test data is prepared and available
- UAT test cases are reviewed and approved

### 2.3 Exit Criteria
- All planned test cases have been executed
- No critical or high-severity defects remain open
- All business requirements have been verified
- Stakeholders have signed off on the UAT results

## 3. Test Environment

### 3.1 Hardware Requirements
