# Activity Issues Fix Documentation

## Issues Identified

### 1. Class Activities Not Showing in Teacher Portal

**Problem**: Activities exist in the database but are not showing in the teacher portal.

**Root Cause**: The teacher is trying to access a class (`cmesxnuwd006muxvpydqerkhi`) that has 5,866 activities but no teacher assignments. The teacher portal correctly enforces access control by only showing activities for classes the teacher is assigned to.

**Database Analysis**:
- Class `cmesxnuwd006muxvpydqerkhi` has 5,866 active activities
- Only 2 teacher assignments exist in the entire system
- Teacher assignments are for different classes: `cmesxnv5y006quxvp7knitflm` (12 activities) and `cmesxnvle006wuxvpxic2pp41` (11 activities)

**Solution**: 
- The system is working correctly - teachers should only see activities for classes they're assigned to
- To test with the class that has many activities, create a teacher assignment for that class
- The API endpoint `api.teacher.getClassActivities` correctly filters by teacher assignments

### 2. Quiz Activity Type Not Available in Create Activity Flow

**Problem**: The quiz.ts model exists but quiz activity type is not showing up in the create activity flow.

**Root Cause**: The quiz activity type was not registered in the activity registry system.

**Files Involved**:
- `src/features/activties/models/quiz.ts` - Contains the quiz models (✅ exists)
- `src/features/activties/components/quiz/QuizEditor.tsx` - Quiz editor component (✅ exists)
- `src/features/activties/components/quiz/QuizViewer.tsx` - Quiz viewer component (✅ exists)
- `src/features/activties/registry/initialize.ts` - Activity registry initialization (❌ missing quiz registration)

**Solution Applied**:

1. **Added quiz activity registration** to `src/features/activties/registry/initialize.ts`:

```typescript
// Added imports
import { QuizEditor } from '../components/quiz/QuizEditor';
import { QuizViewer } from '../components/quiz/QuizViewer';

// Added to initializeActivityRegistry()
registerQuizActivity();

// Added new function
function registerQuizActivity() {
  // Complete quiz activity registration with schema, default config, and components
}
```

2. **Added quiz to ActivityTypeSelectorGrid** in `src/features/activties/components/ActivityTypeSelectorGrid.tsx`:

```typescript
{
  id: 'quiz',
  name: 'Interactive Quiz',
  description: 'Create comprehensive quizzes with multiple question types',
  icon: CheckCircle,
  category: 'assessment',
  difficulty: 'intermediate',
  estimatedTime: '10-45 min',
  features: ['Multiple question types', 'Auto-grading', 'Instant feedback', 'Analytics'],
  gradingMethod: 'auto',
  isPopular: true
}
```

## Technical Details

### Activity Registry System

The application uses a registry pattern for activity types:

1. **Registry Definition**: `src/features/activties/registry/index.ts`
2. **Registry Initialization**: `src/features/activties/registry/initialize.ts`
3. **Activity Types**: Each activity type must be registered with:
   - Schema for validation
   - Default configuration
   - Editor and viewer components
   - Capabilities definition

### Teacher Access Control

The teacher portal implements proper access control:

1. **API Endpoint**: `api.teacher.getClassActivities`
2. **Authorization**: Checks teacher assignments before returning activities
3. **Database Query**: Filters activities by classes the teacher is assigned to
4. **Frontend**: Uses infinite query with cursor-based pagination

### Activity Type Selector

The create activity flow uses:

1. **ActivityTypeSelectorGrid**: Shows available activity types
2. **UnifiedActivityCreator**: Creates activities based on selected type
3. **Registry Integration**: Loads editor components from registry

## Testing

### Test Quiz Registration

Run the test script in browser console:

```javascript
// Load the test script
// Then run:
testQuizRegistration();
testActivityTypeSelectorGrid();
```

### Test Teacher Access

1. Ensure teacher is assigned to a class with activities
2. Navigate to teacher portal → classes → [classId] → activities
3. Verify activities are displayed

## Files Modified

1. `src/features/activties/registry/initialize.ts` - Added quiz activity registration
2. `src/features/activties/components/ActivityTypeSelectorGrid.tsx` - Added quiz to activity types array
3. `test-quiz-registration.js` - Created comprehensive test script for verification
4. `ACTIVITY_ISSUES_FIX.md` - This documentation file

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Quiz activity registration implemented
2. ✅ Quiz activity added to ActivityTypeSelectorGrid
3. ⏳ Test quiz activity appears in create flow
4. ⏳ Verify teacher can create quiz activities
5. ⏳ Test quiz activity functionality end-to-end

## Testing Instructions

### Browser Console Testing

1. Open the teacher portal in your browser
2. Open browser developer console
3. Copy and paste the contents of `test-quiz-registration.js`
4. Run the test functions:
   ```javascript
   testQuizRegistration();
   testActivityTypeSelectorGrid();
   testQuizComponents();
   ```

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Activity Type Selection**:
   - Navigate to teacher portal → classes → [classId] → activities → create
   - Verify "Interactive Quiz" appears in the activity type selector
   - Click on the quiz activity type

2. **Test Quiz Creation**:
   - Select quiz activity type
   - Verify the quiz editor loads properly
   - Try creating a simple quiz with multiple choice questions
   - Save and verify the quiz is created

3. **Test Teacher Access**:
   - Ensure teacher is assigned to a class with activities
   - Navigate to class activities page
   - Verify activities are displayed properly

## Database Queries for Testing

```sql
-- Check activities by class
SELECT "classId", COUNT(*) as activity_count 
FROM activities 
WHERE status = 'ACTIVE' 
GROUP BY "classId" 
ORDER BY activity_count DESC;

-- Check teacher assignments
SELECT ta."classId", c.name as class_name, COUNT(a.id) as activity_count 
FROM teacher_assignments ta 
JOIN classes c ON ta."classId" = c.id 
LEFT JOIN activities a ON a."classId" = ta."classId" AND a.status = 'ACTIVE' 
GROUP BY ta."classId", c.name 
ORDER BY activity_count DESC;

-- Create teacher assignment for testing (if needed)
INSERT INTO teacher_assignments (id, "teacherId", "classId", status, "createdAt", "updatedAt") 
VALUES (
  'test_assignment_' || generate_random_uuid(), 
  'TEACHER_PROFILE_ID', 
  'CLASS_ID', 
  'ACTIVE', 
  NOW(), 
  NOW()
);
```
