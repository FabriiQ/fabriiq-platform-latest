# Comprehensive Data Preparation Solution

## 🎯 **SOLUTION OVERVIEW**

I have successfully created a comprehensive data preparation workflow that addresses all the issues you identified with the FabriiQ Question Bank system. The solution consists of 4 interconnected scripts that systematically prepare your database for large-scale question generation.

## ✅ **COMPLETED DELIVERABLES**

### 1. **Learning Outcomes & Bloom's Taxonomy Setup Script**
**File:** `scripts/01-setup-learning-outcomes-blooms.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ Queries existing database to check current subjects and topics
- ✅ Generates realistic, educationally-appropriate learning outcomes for each subject-topic combination
- ✅ Properly associates each learning outcome with specific Bloom's taxonomy levels (REMEMBER, UNDERSTAND, APPLY, ANALYZE, EVALUATE, CREATE)
- ✅ Ensures proper foreign key relationships between subjects, topics, learning outcomes, and Bloom's taxonomy levels
- ✅ Uses educationally-sound action verbs for each cognitive level
- ✅ Prevents duplicate creation with intelligent checking

**Subject-Specific Templates:**
- Mathematics: Algebra, Geometry, Statistics, Calculus
- English: Grammar, Literature, Writing, Reading
- Science: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Earth Science
- Physical Education: Fitness, Sports, Health
- Life Skills: Communication, Problem Solving, Time Management, Leadership

### 2. **Enhanced Question Generation Script**
**File:** `scripts/02-enhanced-question-generation.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ Uses newly created learning outcomes for question generation
- ✅ Ensures questions are properly aligned with their corresponding Bloom's taxonomy levels
- ✅ Generates complete, validated question data with all required relationships
- ✅ Intelligent question type selection based on Bloom's cognitive level
- ✅ Contextual question stem generation using learning outcomes
- ✅ Complete metadata including subject, topic, learning outcome, and Bloom's level

**Question Type Distribution by Bloom's Level:**
- **Remember/Understand**: Favors multiple choice and true/false
- **Apply**: Balanced with problem-solving types including numeric
- **Analyze/Evaluate**: Emphasizes open-ended questions and essays
- **Create**: Heavily favors essays and project-based questions

### 3. **Question-Subject Association Fix Script**
**File:** `scripts/03-fix-question-subject-associations.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ Identifies questions incorrectly associated with the English subject
- ✅ Re-associates questions with correct subjects based on sophisticated content analysis
- ✅ Updates question bank associations so each subject has its own question bank
- ✅ Verifies that questions are correctly distributed across subjects
- ✅ Uses keyword matching and pattern recognition for accurate classification
- ✅ Provides detailed analysis reports for review

**Content Analysis Engine:**
- **Mathematics**: Equations, formulas, mathematical symbols, calculation patterns
- **Science**: Chemical formulas, scientific units, physics concepts, biological terms
- **English**: Grammar terms, literary devices, author names, writing concepts
- **Physical Education**: Exercise terms, sports, health concepts, fitness metrics
- **Life Skills**: Soft skills, personal development, communication, leadership

### 4. **Data Validation & Integrity Check Script**
**File:** `scripts/04-data-validation-integrity.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ Validates all relationships are properly established
- ✅ Verifies each question has complete metadata
- ✅ Confirms question banks are correctly associated with subjects
- ✅ Comprehensive data integrity checks across the entire system
- ✅ Detailed reporting with specific issue identification
- ✅ Cross-entity relationship validation

**Validation Categories:**
- **Subjects**: Active status, topics, learning outcomes, question banks
- **Topics**: Valid subject references, keyword presence
- **Learning Outcomes**: Complete statements, Bloom's distribution, subject references
- **Questions**: Complete content, subject associations, question bank links
- **Question Banks**: Subject associations, valid references
- **Relationships**: Cross-entity consistency, referential integrity

### 5. **Master Workflow Orchestrator**
**File:** `scripts/00-master-data-preparation-workflow.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ Orchestrates all preparation steps in the correct sequence
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- ✅ Progress tracking and detailed reporting
- ✅ Prerequisites checking
- ✅ Workflow summary with success metrics

## 🚀 **USAGE INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Prerequisites**
1. Ensure your database is running and accessible
2. Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable is set correctly
3. Run initial database seed: `npx prisma db seed`

### **Complete Workflow Execution**
```bash
# Run the complete data preparation workflow
npx tsx scripts/00-master-data-preparation-workflow.ts
```

### **Individual Script Execution**
```bash
# 1. Set up learning outcomes and Bloom's taxonomy
npx tsx scripts/01-setup-learning-outcomes-blooms.ts

# 2. Generate enhanced questions (optional)
npx tsx scripts/02-enhanced-question-generation.ts

# 3. Fix question-subject associations
npx tsx scripts/03-fix-question-subject-associations.ts

# 4. Validate data integrity
npx tsx scripts/04-data-validation-integrity.ts
```

## 📊 **EXPECTED RESULTS**

### **Before Workflow:**
```
❌ Learning Outcomes: 0
❌ Proper Subject Distribution: ~15% (most questions in English)
❌ Question Bank Structure: Inconsistent
❌ Data Integrity: Multiple validation failures
❌ Bloom's Taxonomy: Not properly aligned
```

### **After Workflow:**
```
✅ Learning Outcomes: 150+ (6 per subject-topic combination)
✅ Proper Subject Distribution: 100% (questions correctly distributed)
✅ Question Bank Structure: Each subject has its own question bank
✅ Data Integrity: All validations pass
✅ Bloom's Taxonomy: Properly aligned with learning outcomes
```

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Data Flow:**
1. **Setup Phase**: Create learning outcomes aligned with Bloom's taxonomy
2. **Analysis Phase**: Analyze existing questions for correct subject association
3. **Fix Phase**: Re-associate questions with correct subjects and question banks
4. **Validation Phase**: Comprehensive integrity checks and reporting

### **Key Algorithms:**
- **Content Analysis**: Keyword matching with weighted scoring
- **Pattern Recognition**: Regular expressions for subject-specific patterns
- **Relationship Validation**: Cross-entity consistency checks
- **Batch Processing**: Optimized database operations

### **Error Handling:**
