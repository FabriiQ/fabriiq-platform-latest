- `questionType` - Type based on Bloom's level
- `difficulty` - Derived from Bloom's level
- `content` - Complete question content (JSON)
- `metadata` - Rich metadata (JSON)
- `bloomsLevel` - Bloom's taxonomy level
- `learningOutcomeIds` - Associated learning outcomes
- `subjectId` - Subject reference
- `topicId` - Topic reference
- `gradeLevel` - Grade level (7 or 8)
- `year` - Current year (2025)
- `createdById` - System user ID

**REMEMBER & UNDERSTAND** (Lower-order thinking):
- Multiple Choice (35-40%)
- True/False (20-30%)
- Fill in the Blanks (20%)
- Short Answer (10-25%)

**APPLY & ANALYZE** (Middle-order thinking):
- Numeric (30%)
- Short Answer (25-30%)
- Multiple Choice (20-25%)
- Multiple Response (15-20%)

**EVALUATE & CREATE** (Higher-order thinking):
