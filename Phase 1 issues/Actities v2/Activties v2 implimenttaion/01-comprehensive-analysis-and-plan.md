# Activities V2 Comprehensive Analysis and Implementation Plan

## üéØ Executive Summary

Activities V2 is a complete reimplementation of the activities system with three core activity types (Quiz, Reading, Video) that leverages the existing Question Bank as the primary source of truth. This implementation includes advanced features like CAT/IRT, spaced repetition, comprehensive achievement systems, and seamless integration with existing analytics and time tracking.

## üìä Current System Analysis

### Existing Activities System Strengths
- **Robust Data Model**: Activity and ActivityGrade tables with flexible JSON content
- **Question Bank Integration**: Comprehensive question types and management system
- **Time Tracking**: Mature TimeTrackingProvider and learning-time services
- **Analytics Pipeline**: Activity analytics manager with event tracking
- **Achievement System**: Points, badges, and achievement tracking infrastructure
- **Grading System**: Per-question-type grading functions and auto-grading

### Current System Limitations
- **Complex Activity Types**: 15+ activity types creating maintenance overhead
- **Inconsistent UX**: Different interfaces for similar functionality
- **Limited Question Analytics**: No usage tracking for Question Bank questions
- **Achievement Configuration**: Limited customization for activity-specific achievements
- **Assessment Capabilities**: No CAT/IRT or adaptive testing features
