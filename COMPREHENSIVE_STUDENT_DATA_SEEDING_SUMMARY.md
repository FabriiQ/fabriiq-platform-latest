## üîÑ Seed Process Flow

The enhanced seed process now follows this order:

1. **Basic Setup** (institutions, campuses, users, classes, subjects)
2. **Content Creation** (activities, assessments)
3. **Student Enrollment** (bulk students, enrollments)
4. **Performance Data** (comprehensive activity grades)
5. **Analytics Generation** (performance analytics, Bloom's progression)
6. **Achievement System** (achievements, points, levels)
7. **Profile Enhancement** (goals, personal bests, journey events)
8. **Topic Mastery** (mastery levels, learning patterns)

## üìä Data Volume Generated

- **Achievements**: 6-8 achievements per student
- **Points Records**: 50+ point entries per student
- **Learning Goals**: 2-3 goals per student
- **Personal Bests**: 2+ records per subject
- **Journey Events**: 3-5 events per student
- **Topic Mastery**: Records for all subject topics

### System-Wide:
- **Total Activity Grades**: 12,000+ records
- **Performance Analytics**: 12,000+ records
- **Student Achievements**: 2,400+ records
- **Points Records**: 15,000+ records
- **Leaderboard Entries**: 900+ aggregate records
