# Teacher Assistant v2 Fixes - Test Plan

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Fixed undefined lastMessage in conversation history
- **Problem**: History showed "undefined..." for conversations with no messages
- **Fix**: Updated `getConversationHistory` in router.ts to properly handle null/undefined content
- **Test**: Check that conversations without messages show null lastMessage instead of "undefined..."

### 2. ✅ Fixed conversation title generation and updates
- **Problem**: All conversations showed "New Conversation" instead of meaningful titles
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `generateConversationTitle()` function with comprehensive pattern matching
  - Updated both client and server-side title extraction
  - Added automatic title update when first user message is saved
- **Test**: Create conversations with different types of requests and verify meaningful titles

### 3. ✅ Standardized loading states and thinking indicators
- **Problem**: Inconsistent messages like "Hmm...", "thinking", "ok"
- **Fix**: Standardized all loading states to use "Analyzing your request..." and "Preparing your content..."
- **Test**: Check all loading states show consistent, professional messages

### 4. ✅ Fixed conversation state management and message persistence
- **Problem**: Messages disappearing, state corruption when switching conversations
- **Fix**: 
  - Added better logging and debugging
  - Improved conversation history refetch logic to prevent excessive refetching
  - Enhanced message loading logic with proper state checks
- **Test**: Switch between conversations and verify messages persist correctly

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Create New Conversation with Meaningful Title
1. Go to Teacher Assistant v2
2. Send message: "create worksheet on photosynthesis for grade 5"
3. ✅ Verify conversation title becomes "Photosynthesis" or similar (not "New Conversation")
4. Check history sidebar shows the meaningful title

### Scenario 2: Conversation History Display
1. Create multiple conversations with different requests
2. ✅ Verify history sidebar shows:
   - Meaningful titles (not "New Conversation")
   - Correct message counts
   - No "undefined..." in lastMessage preview
   - Proper timestamps

### Scenario 3: Loading States Consistency
1. Send various messages and observe loading indicators
2. ✅ Verify all show consistent messages:
   - "Analyzing your request..." for thinking
   - "Preparing your content..." for content generation
   - No "Hmm..." or other inconsistent messages

### Scenario 4: Conversation Switching
1. Create conversation A with some messages
2. Create conversation B with different messages
3. Switch back to conversation A
4. ✅ Verify:
   - Messages from A are still there
   - No messages from B appear in A
   - Conversation state is preserved

### Scenario 5: Message Persistence
1. Send a message and wait for response
2. Refresh the page
3. ✅ Verify:
   - Conversation is restored
   - All messages are still there
   - Last document/artifact is restored if applicable

## Database Verification

Check Supabase tables:
- `teacher_assistant_conversations`: Verify titles are meaningful, not "New Conversation"
- `teacher_assistant_messages`: Verify messages are being saved correctly
- Check that conversation `updatedAt` is being updated when messages are added

## Console Logs to Monitor

With the added debugging, monitor these console logs:
- "Loading conversation messages: X" - when messages are loaded
- "Setting initial messages from conversation" - when conversation is first loaded
- "Message count changed, updating messages" - when new messages arrive
- "Saving message to conversation" - when messages are being saved
- "Message saved successfully" - confirmation of successful save
- "Refetching conversation history for new conversation" - when history is refetched

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **History Sidebar**: Shows meaningful conversation titles and proper message previews
2. **Loading States**: Consistent, professional messaging throughout
3. **Conversation Switching**: Smooth transitions without state corruption
4. **Message Persistence**: All messages saved and restored correctly
5. **Title Generation**: Automatic, meaningful titles based on user requests

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the main changes can be reverted by:
1. Reverting router.ts changes to original lastMessage logic
2. Reverting title generation functions
3. Removing debug logging
4. Restoring original loading state messages
