## 🚨 Important Notes

### Before Running:
1. **Backup your database** if running on production data
2. **Ensure base data exists** (institutions, campuses, classes, subjects, users)
3. **Check Supabase limits** to ensure sufficient capacity
4. **Verify Year 8 C class exists** in your database

### After Running:
1. **Check the summary report** displayed at the end of seeding
2. **Verify student and teacher login credentials** work
3. **Test all dashboard components** for data display
4. **Monitor database performance** with the new data volume

### Troubleshooting:
- **"Year 8 C class not found"**: Ensure the class exists with that exact name
- **"No students found"**: Verify students are enrolled in Year 8 C class
- **"Permission denied"**: Check database connection and permissions
- **"Duplicate key errors"**: Some data may already exist (scripts handle this gracefully)
