# Student Assistant: Onboarding Guide for Students

This guide will walk you through how to get started with your Learning Assistant and make the most of this powerful tool.

## Introduction (5 minutes)

### What is the Learning Assistant?

The Learning Assistant is your personal AI study companion that can help you:
- Understand difficult concepts
- Develop problem-solving skills
- Find resources in the student portal
- Stay on track with your learning goals
- Get help when teachers aren't available

### How It Works

The assistant uses artificial intelligence to:
1. Understand your questions
2. Provide helpful guidance
3. Remember your previous conversations
4. Offer personalized suggestions
5. Adapt to your learning style

## Getting Started (10 minutes)

### Activity 1: Finding and Opening the Assistant

1. Log in to your student portal
2. Look for the chat icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen
3. Click the icon to open the assistant
4. Notice the two tabs at the top: "Chat" and "Suggestions"

### Activity 2: Your First Conversation

Let's practice having a conversation with the assistant:

1. Click on the "Chat" tab if it's not already selected
2. Type a greeting like "Hello" or "Hi" and press Enter
3. Read the assistant's response
4. Ask a simple question about how the assistant can help you
5. Notice how the assistant responds with helpful information

## Effective Questioning (15 minutes)

### Activity 3: Asking Subject Questions

Practice asking questions about subjects you're studying:

**Try these examples:**
- "Can you help me understand how photosynthesis works?"
- "What are the key events that led to World War II?"
- "How do I solve equations with variables on both sides?"

### Activity 4: Asking vs. Telling

Notice the difference in responses when you:

1. Ask for an answer directly:
   - "What's the answer to 3x + 5 = 20?"

2. Ask for guidance:
   - "Can you help me solve 3x + 5 = 20?"

3. Share your thinking:
   - "I'm trying to solve 3x + 5 = 20. I think I need to subtract 5 from both sides first, is that right?"

### Activity 5: Follow-up Questions

Practice asking follow-up questions to deepen your understanding:

1. Start with a basic question
2. When the assistant responds, ask a more specific question about something in the response
3. Continue the conversation with 2-3 more follow-up questions

## Using Suggestions (10 minutes)

### Activity 6: Exploring the Suggestions Tab

1. Click on the "Suggestions" tab
2. Review the available suggestions
3. Click on a suggestion to expand it
4. Try the suggested action by clicking the action button
