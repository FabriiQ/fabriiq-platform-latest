# Student Assistant: Teacher Training Guide

This training guide will help you understand the Student Assistant, its educational approach, and how to effectively integrate it into your classroom.

## Module 1: Understanding the Student Assistant (30 minutes)

### What is the Student Assistant?

The Student Assistant is an AI-powered educational tool designed to:
- Provide personalized learning support to students
- Encourage critical thinking and metacognition
- Help students develop self-directed learning skills
- Reduce common questions and administrative burden

### Educational Foundations

The assistant is built on established educational psychology principles:

1. **Socratic Questioning**: Guides students to discover answers through thoughtful questions
2. **Scaffolding**: Provides appropriate levels of support based on student needs
3. **Zone of Proximal Development**: Targets assistance at the right level of challenge
4. **Growth Mindset**: Emphasizes effort and strategy over innate ability
5. **Metacognition**: Encourages students to reflect on their thinking processes

### Demonstration: Experiencing the Assistant

1. Access the Student Assistant through the teacher portal
2. Try asking subject-specific questions
3. Notice how the assistant guides rather than tells
4. Explore the suggestions feature
5. Review the analytics dashboard

## Module 2: Classroom Implementation (45 minutes)

### Introducing the Assistant to Students

#### Step 1: Preparation
- Schedule 20-30 minutes for initial introduction
- Ensure all students have access to devices
- Prepare example questions for demonstration

#### Step 2: Introduction Script
"Today we're going to learn about a new tool called the Learning Assistant. This is an AI helper that can support your learning both in class and at home. It's designed to guide you through problems and help you understand concepts, not just give you answers."

#### Step 3: Demonstration
- Show how to access the assistant
- Demonstrate asking effective questions
- Show the suggestions feature
- Explain privacy considerations

#### Step 4: Guided Practice
- Have students open the assistant
- Provide simple starter questions
- Walk around to assist students
- Share good examples with the class

### Classroom Activities

#### Activity 1: Research Companion
- Assign a research topic
- Have students use the assistant to:
  - Develop research questions
  - Find relevant information
  - Organize their findings
  - Reflect on their learning

#### Activity 2: Concept Reinforcement
- After teaching a new concept:
  - Have students explain the concept to the assistant
  - Ask them to identify areas where they're still confused
  - Use the assistant to explore those areas further
  - Share insights in a class discussion

#### Activity 3: Differentiated Support
- During independent work time:
  - Have advanced students ask the assistant for extension questions
  - Direct struggling students to ask for simplified explanations
  - Use the assistant to provide additional examples

## Module 3: Monitoring and Assessment (30 minutes)
