# Student Assistant User Guide

Welcome to your Learning Assistant! This guide will help you understand how to use the assistant effectively to enhance your learning experience.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Assistant

The Learning Assistant is available throughout the student portal. You can access it in two ways:

1. **Floating Button**: Look for the chat icon button in the bottom-right corner of your screen. Click it to open the assistant.
2. **Suggestions Tab**: When the assistant has suggestions for you, you'll see a notification badge on the button.

### Interface Overview

The assistant has two main tabs:

- **Chat**: Where you can ask questions and have conversations with the assistant
- **Suggestions**: Where you'll find personalized recommendations and reminders

## Using the Chat Feature

### Asking Questions

You can ask the assistant about:

- **Subject-specific questions**: "Can you help me understand photosynthesis?"
- **Navigation help**: "Where can I find my assignments?"
- **Learning strategies**: "What's the best way to study for a math test?"

### How to Get the Best Responses

The assistant is designed to help you learn, not just give you answers. For the best experience:

1. **Be specific**: The more details you provide, the better the assistant can help you.
2. **Ask follow-up questions**: If you don't understand something, ask for clarification.
3. **Explain your thinking**: Sharing your thought process helps the assistant guide you better.

### Example Conversations

**Good Example:**
```
You: I'm having trouble understanding how to solve quadratic equations.
Assistant: Let's break this down. What part is confusing you - the formula, factoring, or something else?
You: I understand the formula, but I'm not sure when to use factoring versus the quadratic formula.
Assistant: That's a great question! Let's look at some examples to understand when each approach works best...
```

**Less Effective Example:**
```
You: How do I solve xÂ² + 5x + 6 = 0?
Assistant: I'd be happy to help you work through this. Let's start by thinking about how we might approach this problem. What methods do you know for solving quadratic equations?
You: Just give me the answer.
Assistant: I understand you want the solution, but I'm here to help you learn how to solve it yourself. Let's try factoring this equation together...
```

## Using the Suggestions Feature

The assistant will provide personalized suggestions such as:

- **Review reminders**: Topics you should revisit based on your learning patterns
