# Teacher Assistant Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Teacher Assistant is an AI-powered chat interface that provides comprehensive support for teachers across all aspects of their professional responsibilities. It integrates with the platform's existing systems to offer personalized guidance, content creation assistance, classroom management support, and access to external knowledge through Jina Search integration.

## Goals

1. **Teaching Support**: Assist with lesson planning, content creation, and pedagogical strategies
2. **Student Management**: Help track student progress, identify intervention needs, and personalize learning
3. **Administrative Efficiency**: Streamline administrative tasks and documentation
4. **Professional Development**: Provide research-based teaching strategies and continuous learning
5. **Knowledge Access**: Enable search capabilities to access external information when needed

## Educational Psychology Principles

The Teacher Assistant is designed based on the following educational psychology principles:

### 1. Cognitive Load Theory
- Reduce extraneous cognitive load by automating routine tasks
- Optimize germane cognitive load by focusing teacher attention on high-impact activities
- Present information in manageable chunks with clear organization

### 2. Adult Learning Theory (Andragogy)
- Respect teachers as self-directed professionals
- Connect assistance to immediate professional needs
- Build on existing knowledge and experience
- Provide problem-centered rather than subject-centered assistance

### 3. Reflective Practice
- Encourage reflection on teaching methods and outcomes
- Provide data-informed insights for consideration
- Support iterative improvement through action research

### 4. Differentiated Instruction Support
- Help teachers develop strategies for diverse learners
- Suggest differentiation approaches for content, process, and product
- Provide resources for various learning profiles and needs

### 5. Evidence-Based Teaching
- Recommend strategies with strong research support
- Provide access to current educational research
- Connect classroom practices to learning science

The Teacher Assistant integrates Jina Search to provide access to external knowledge sources, including:

- Educational research papers
- Teaching resources and lesson plans
- Subject-specific content and explanations
- Curriculum standards and frameworks
- Best practices and case studies

#### Search Implementation

```typescript
// src/features/teacher-assistant/search-agent.ts
export class SearchAgent {
  private jinaClient: JinaClient;

  constructor(apiKey: string) {
    this.jinaClient = new JinaClient({
      apiKey,
      defaultHeaders: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
  }

  async search(query: string, filters?: SearchFilters): Promise<SearchResult[]> {
    try {
      // Prepare search parameters
      const params: JinaSearchParams = {
        query,
        limit: filters?.limit || 5,
        filter: this.buildFilterExpression(filters)
      };

      // Execute search
      const response = await this.jinaClient.search(params);

      // Process and return results
      return response.matches.map(match => ({
        id: match.id,
        title: match.metadata.title,
        snippet: match.metadata.snippet,
        url: match.metadata.url,
        source: match.metadata.source,
        relevanceScore: match.score
      }));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error executing Jina search:', error);
      throw new Error(`Search failed: ${(error as Error).message}`);
    }
  }

  private buildFilterExpression(filters?: SearchFilters): string {
    if (!filters) return '';

    const expressions = [];

    if (filters.contentType) {
      expressions.push(`content_type = "${filters.contentType}"`);
    }

    if (filters.subject) {
      expressions.push(`subject = "${filters.subject}"`);
    }

    if (filters.gradeLevel) {
      expressions.push(`grade_level = "${filters.gradeLevel}"`);
    }

    if (filters.dateRange) {
      expressions.push(`publication_date >= "${filters.dateRange.start}" AND publication_date <= "${filters.dateRange.end}"`);
    }

    return expressions.join(' AND ');
  }
}
```

#### Search UI Components

```tsx
// src/components/teacher-assistant/SearchInterface.tsx
export function SearchInterface() {
  const { searchQuery, setSearchQuery, searchResults, isSearching, executeSearch } = useTeacherAssistant();
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState<SearchFilters>({
    contentType: 'all',
    subject: '',
    gradeLevel: '',
    dateRange: null
  });

  const handleSearch = () => {
    if (!searchQuery.trim()) return;
    executeSearch(searchQuery, filters);
  };

  const handleKeyPress = (e: React.KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (e.key === 'Enter') {
      handleSearch();
    }
  };

  return (

### 3. Agent System

The Teacher Assistant leverages the existing agent system in `src/features/agents` to provide specialized support across different teaching domains:

#### TeacherAssistantOrchestrator
- Serves as the main entry point for teacher interactions
- Classifies teacher intents and routes to appropriate specialized agents
- Provides seamless transitions between conversational assistance and specialized agent capabilities

#### Integration with Existing Agents
The Teacher Assistant integrates with these existing specialized agents:

- **LessonPlanAgent**: For curriculum planning, lesson design, and resource selection
- **AssessmentAgent**: For assessment creation, grading, and analysis
- **WorksheetAgent**: For creating educational worksheets with print layout optimization
- **ContentRefinementAgent**: For improving and adapting educational content
- **SearchAgent**: For external knowledge retrieval and content discovery
- **ResourceAgent**: For educational resource integration
- **FeedbackAgent**: For content quality assessment

#### Teacher-Specific Extensions
The Teacher Assistant extends the agent system with teacher-specific capabilities:

- **Student Management**: Tracking progress, identifying intervention needs, and personalizing learning
- **Teaching Strategy Recommendations**: Suggesting evidence-based teaching approaches
- **Administrative Support**: Streamlining administrative tasks and documentation

## Key Features
