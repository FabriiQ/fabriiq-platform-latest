# Teacher Assistant UI/UX Refinements

## Mobile-First Design Principles

The Teacher Assistant has been designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring optimal usability across all devices. The following principles have been applied:

### 2. Touch-Friendly Interface

- **Large Touch Targets**: All interactive elements are at least 44x44px for easy tapping
- **Comfortable Spacing**: Adequate spacing between elements to prevent accidental taps
- **Swipe Gestures**: Support for swipe gestures to dismiss the assistant on mobile

### 3. Optimized Content Display

- **Readable Text**: Minimum 16px font size for body text
- **Adaptive Content**: Content that adjusts to screen width without horizontal scrolling
