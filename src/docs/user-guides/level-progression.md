# How to Progress Through Levels

This guide explains how the level system works in the student portal and how you can progress through levels.

## What Are Levels?

Levels are a way to track your overall progress and achievements in the learning platform. As you earn points from activities, logins, and achievements, you'll progress through levels. Higher levels indicate more experience and accomplishment.

## Understanding the Level System

### Level Thresholds

Each level requires a certain number of points:

| Level | Points Required | Points to Next Level |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| Level 1 | 0-100 points | 101 points |
| Level 2 | 101-250 points | 150 points |
| Level 3 | 251-500 points | 250 points |
| Level 4 | 501-1000 points | 500 points |
| Level 5 | 1001-2000 points | 1000 points |
| Level 6 | 2001-3500 points | 1500 points |
| Level 7 | 3501-5500 points | 2000 points |
| Level 8 | 5501-8000 points | 2500 points |
| Level 9 | 8001-11000 points | 3000 points |
| Level 10 | 11001-15000 points | 4000 points |
| Level 11+ | 15001+ points | Varies |

As you can see, each level requires more points than the previous one, creating an increasing challenge as you progress.

### Level Colors and Badges

Each level range has a distinct color scheme and badge:

- **Levels 1-3**: Bronze/Copper
- **Levels 4-6**: Silver/Gray
- **Levels 7-9**: Gold/Yellow
- **Levels 10-12**: Emerald/Green
- **Levels 13-15**: Sapphire/Blue

These colors appear on your profile, in leaderboards, and in other places where your level is displayed.

## Tracking Your Level

You can track your level in several places:

### Dashboard

Your dashboard shows your current level and progress toward the next level:

### Profile Page

Your profile page shows detailed information about your level:

- Current level
- Progress toward next level
- Points needed for next level
- Level history (when you reached each level)

### Leaderboards

Leaderboards show your level alongside your rank and points:

## Level-Up Celebrations

When you reach a new level, you'll receive a celebration:

- A visual animation appears on screen
- A toast notification congratulates you
- A sound effect plays (if enabled)
- A level-specific achievement is unlocked
- A small bonus is awarded for reaching certain level milestones

## Level Benefits

Higher levels provide several benefits:

1. **Recognition**: Your level badge appears next to your name in leaderboards and other places
2. **Achievement Progress**: Some achievements are tied to reaching certain levels
3. **Profile Enhancement**: Higher levels may unlock additional profile customization options
4. **Point Multipliers**: At very high levels (10+), you may earn small point multipliers for certain activities

## Ways to Level Up Faster

1. **Complete activities regularly** to earn points
2. **Aim for high scores** on graded activities to maximize points
3. **Log in daily** to maintain your streak bonus
4. **Work toward achievements** for bonus points
5. **Complete bonus activities** when available
6. **Participate in special events** that may offer bonus points

## Level Progress Calculation

Your progress toward the next level is calculated as:

```
Progress Percentage = (Current Points - Current Level Minimum) / (Next Level Minimum - Current Level Minimum) × 100%
```

For example, if you have 175 points:
- You're at Level 2 (101-250 points)
- Current Level Minimum = 101 points
- Next Level Minimum = 251 points
- Progress = (175 - 101) / (251 - 101) × 100% = 74 / 150 × 100% = 49.3%

This means you're about 49% of the way to Level 3.

## Class-Specific Levels

In some cases, you may have class-specific levels in addition to your overall level:

- Class-specific levels are based only on points earned within that class
- They follow the same threshold system as overall levels
- They're displayed on class pages and class leaderboards
