# How to View Leaderboards

This guide explains how to view and understand leaderboards in the student portal, which show how your performance compares to other students.

## What Are Leaderboards?

Leaderboards are rankings that show how students compare to each other based on points earned, activities completed, and achievements unlocked. They provide a way to see your progress relative to your peers and can motivate you to improve.

## Types of Leaderboards

The student portal offers several types of leaderboards:

### Class Leaderboards

Class leaderboards show rankings within a specific class:

- Only students in your class are included
- Rankings are based on points earned in that class
- You can see your position relative to your classmates

- You can see how you compare to students in other classes

## Time Periods

Each leaderboard type can be filtered by different time periods:

- **All-Time**: Based on all points earned since account creation
- **Term**: Based on points earned during the current academic term
- **Monthly**: Based on points earned during the current calendar month
- **Weekly**: Based on points earned during the current week (Monday-Sunday)
- **Daily**: Based on points earned during the current day

This allows you to see both long-term performance and recent progress.

## Privacy Considerations

Leaderboards are designed with privacy in mind:

- Only your name and basic performance metrics are visible to other students
- Detailed information about your activities and achievements is not shared
- You can see your own detailed information when viewing leaderboards

## Tips for Improving Your Rank

1. **Complete activities regularly** to earn points
2. **Aim for high scores** on graded activities
3. **Log in daily** to maintain your streak bonus
4. **Work toward achievements** for bonus points
5. **Focus on recent time periods** (daily, weekly) if you want to see faster progress
