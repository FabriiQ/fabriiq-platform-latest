# How to Earn Points

This guide explains how you can earn points in the student portal, which contribute to your level and position on leaderboards.

## What Are Points?

Points are a way to track your progress and achievements in the learning platform. They are awarded for completing activities, logging in regularly, and unlocking achievements. The more points you earn, the higher your level will be and the higher you'll rank on leaderboards.

## Ways to Earn Points

### 1. Complete Activities

The primary way to earn points is by completing activities assigned to you:

- **Graded Activities**: You earn points equal to your score percentage. For example, if you score 85% on a quiz, you earn 85 points.
- **Non-graded Activities**: These typically award between 10-50 points, depending on the complexity.
- **Practice Activities**: These award fewer points (5-15) but are a great way to build skills.
- **Bonus Activities**: Special challenge activities can award up to 100 points.

### 2. Log In Regularly

Just by logging in, you can earn points:

- **Daily Login**: 5 points for logging in each day
- **Streak Bonus**: Additional points for consecutive days of logging in:
  - 2 days: 10 points (5 × 2)
  - 3 days: 15 points (5 × 3)
  - 4 days: 20 points (5 × 4)
  - 5+ days: 25 points (maximum streak bonus)
- **First Activity of the Day**: 10 bonus points for completing your first activity each day
