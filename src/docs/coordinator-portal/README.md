## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The Coordinator Portal is built using:
- Next.js for the frontend framework
- tRPC for type-safe API calls
- Prisma for database access
- IndexedDB for offline data storage
- React Context for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Offline Storage Implementation

The offline functionality is implemented using IndexedDB with the following stores:

1. **Teachers Store**
   - Caches teacher data for offline access
   - Indexed by teacher ID and last updated timestamp

2. **Students Store**
   - Caches student data for offline access
   - Indexed by student ID, class ID, and last updated timestamp

3. **Classes Store**
   - Caches class data for offline access
   - Indexed by class ID and last updated timestamp

4. **Analytics Store**
   - Caches analytics data for offline access
   - Indexed by type, reference ID, and last updated timestamp

5. **Sync Queue Store**
   - Tracks operations that need to be synchronized with the server
   - Includes create, update, and delete operations

### Data Synchronization

The synchronization process:
1. Detects when the application comes back online
2. Processes the sync queue in order of creation
3. Handles conflicts using a "server wins" strategy
4. Updates local cache with fresh data from the server

### Mobile-First Implementation

The mobile-first approach includes:
1. Responsive grid layouts using Tailwind CSS
2. Separate components for mobile and desktop views
3. Touch-friendly UI elements with appropriate sizing
4. Optimized data loading for mobile networks
