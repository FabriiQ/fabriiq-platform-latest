## Implementation Details

### Assessment Creation Flow

1. **Basic Information**
   - Title, description, subject, class, etc.
   - Assessment type selection
   - Due date and other metadata

2. **Question Creation**
   - Question type selection
   - Question bank integration and alignment
   - Question content creation
   - Bloom's level assignment
   - Points allocation

3. **Cognitive Balance Analysis**
   - Visualization of Bloom's distribution
   - Recommendations for balance
   - Question suggestions

4. **Rubric Selection/Creation**
   - Rubric template selection
   - Customization of criteria
   - Alignment with Bloom's levels

5. **Preview and Finalization**
   - Print preview
   - Online preview
   - Final adjustments

### Grading Workflow

1. **Submission Review**
   - View student submissions
   - Compare with answer key
   - Access student history

2. **Rubric-Based Grading**
   - Select appropriate criteria levels
   - Add specific feedback
   - Calculate scores

3. **Feedback Generation**
   - Automated feedback suggestions
   - Customization options
   - Bloom's level-specific feedback

4. **Batch Processing**
   - Grade multiple submissions
   - Apply common feedback
   - Review and adjust
