## Implementation Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Database Schema Design & Implementation

**Objective**: Create robust database models for all Social Wall entities

**Key Models**:
- `SocialPost` - Main post entity with content and metadata
- `SocialComment` - Comments on posts with threading support
- `SocialReaction` - Reactions (like, love, celebrate) with user tracking
- `SocialUserTag` - User mentions in posts and comments
- `SocialModerationLog` - Audit trail for moderation actions
- `SocialArchive` - Archived content for performance optimization

**Features**:
- Proper foreign key relationships with existing Class, User models
- Optimized indexes for real-time queries
- Soft delete support for moderation
- Partitioning strategy for scalability

### 2. Real-Time Infrastructure Setup

**Objective**: Implement Socket.IO infrastructure for real-time communication

**Components**:
- Socket.IO server configuration with authentication
- Class-based namespaces (`/class-${classId}`)
- Connection management and user presence tracking
- Event broadcasting system for posts, comments, reactions
- Reconnection handling and offline support

**Events**:
- `post:created`, `post:updated`, `post:deleted`
- `comment:created`, `comment:updated`, `comment:deleted`
- `reaction:added`, `reaction:removed`
- `user:tagged`, `moderation:action`

### 3. tRPC API Development

**Objective**: Create comprehensive API endpoints for Social Wall operations

**Router Structure**:
```typescript
socialWallRouter = {
  // Post operations
  createPost, updatePost, deletePost, getClassPosts,
  
  // Comment operations  
  createComment, updateComment, deleteComment, getPostComments,
  
  // Reaction operations
  addReaction, removeReaction, getPostReactions,
  
  // Moderation operations
  moderatePost, moderateComment, getModerationLogs,
  
  // User operations
  tagUsers, getTaggedPosts, getUserActivity
}
```

**Security Features**:
- Role-based permission checks
- Content validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for post creation
- Audit logging for all operations

### 4. Core UI Components Development

**Objective**: Build reusable, responsive React components

**Component Hierarchy**:
```
SocialWall/
├── SocialWallContainer
├── PostCreator (Teachers/Coordinators only)
├── PostFeed
│   ├── PostCard
│   │   ├── PostContent
│   │   ├── PostActions (React, Comment, Share)
│   │   ├── PostComments
│   │   └── PostModerationControls
│   └── PostSkeleton (Loading states)
├── CommentSystem
│   ├── CommentInput
│   ├── CommentList
│   └── CommentCard
├── ReactionSystem
│   ├── ReactionPicker
