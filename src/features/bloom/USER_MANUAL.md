# Learning Outcomes Creation and Generation User Manual

## Introduction

This manual guides you through creating and generating learning outcomes using Bloom's Taxonomy in our educational platform. The system helps you create well-structured learning outcomes aligned with cognitive levels to improve curriculum design and student assessment.

## What is Bloom's Taxonomy?

Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework that classifies educational goals into six cognitive levels of increasing complexity:

1. **Remember**: Recall facts and basic concepts
2. **Understand**: Explain ideas or concepts
3. **Apply**: Use information in new situations
4. **Analyze**: Draw connections among ideas
5. **Evaluate**: Justify a stand or decision
6. **Create**: Produce new or original work

Each level is associated with specific action verbs that help formulate clear learning outcomes.

## Getting Started

### Accessing Learning Outcomes

1. Navigate to your institution dashboard
2. Select a subject from the subjects list
3. Click on "Learning Outcomes" in the sidebar or subject detail page
4. You can view all learning outcomes or filter by topic

### Understanding the Interface

The learning outcomes page includes:

- **Distribution Chart**: Shows the distribution of learning outcomes across Bloom's Taxonomy levels
- **Learning Outcome List**: Displays existing learning outcomes with their taxonomy levels
- **Generation Tools**: AI-powered tools to help create new learning outcomes

## Creating Learning Outcomes Manually

### Step 1: Start the Creation Process

1. Click the "+ Create Learning Outcome" button
2. The learning outcome form will appear

### Step 2: Select a Bloom's Taxonomy Level

1. Choose one of the six cognitive levels (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create)
2. Each level is color-coded and includes a description to help you select the appropriate level
3. The system will show recommended action verbs for the selected level

### Step 3: Select Action Verbs

1. Click on suggested action verbs to add them to your selection
2. Selected verbs appear as tags that can be removed if needed
3. You must select at least one action verb

### Step 4: Write the Learning Outcome Statement

1. Enter a clear statement that begins with "Students will be able to..."
2. Incorporate the selected action verb(s) in your statement
3. Focus on measurable and observable outcomes

### Step 5: Add a Description (Optional)

1. Provide additional context or details about the learning outcome
2. Explain how it aligns with curriculum goals or assessment strategies

### Step 6: Save the Learning Outcome

1. Click "Create Learning Outcome" to save
2. The new outcome will appear in the learning outcomes list
3. The distribution chart will update to reflect the new outcome

## Generating Learning Outcomes with AI

### Single Level Generation

1. From the learning outcomes page, click "Generate Learning Outcomes" button
2. In the dialog that appears, select the "Single Level Generation" tab
3. Choose a Bloom's Taxonomy level
4. Optionally select preferred action verbs
5. Add any custom prompts or context in the text area
6. Click "Generate Learning Outcomes"
7. Review the generated outcomes
8. For each outcome, you can:
   - Click "Preview & Edit" to modify before saving
   - Click "Save" to save directly to your learning outcomes

### Bulk Generation

1. From the learning outcomes page, click "Generate Learning Outcomes" button
2. Select the "Bulk Generation" tab
3. Check the Bloom's Taxonomy levels you want to generate outcomes for
4. Optionally select preferred action verbs for each level
5. Add any custom prompts or context in the text area
6. Click "Generate for Selected Levels"
7. The system will generate and save outcomes for all selected levels
8. You can view the generated outcomes in the dialog and on the learning outcomes page

## Tips for Effective Learning Outcomes

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly state what students should know or be able to do
2. **Be Measurable**: Ensure outcomes can be assessed through assignments or exams
3. **Use Action Verbs**: Start with verbs that match the cognitive level
4. **Focus on Student Learning**: Describe what students will learn, not what you will teach
5. **Balance Cognitive Levels**: Include outcomes across different Bloom's levels
6. **Align with Assessments**: Ensure outcomes connect to your assessment methods

## Managing Learning Outcomes

### Editing Learning Outcomes

1. Find the learning outcome in the list
2. Click the "Edit" button
3. Make your changes in the edit dialog
4. Click "Save Changes"

### Deleting Learning Outcomes

1. Find the learning outcome in the list
2. Click the "Delete" button
3. Confirm the deletion in the confirmation dialog

### Filtering and Searching

1. Use the search bar to find specific learning outcomes
2. Filter by Bloom's Taxonomy level using the filter dropdown
3. Filter by topic using the tabs at the top of the list

## Topic-Level Learning Outcomes

### Viewing Topic Learning Outcomes

1. Navigate to a specific topic page
2. Click "Manage Learning Outcomes" button
3. View learning outcomes specific to that topic

### Topic Distribution Analysis

1. On the topic learning outcomes page, view the distribution chart
2. Compare actual distribution to recommended distribution
3. Use this information to identify gaps in cognitive coverage

## Troubleshooting

### Generation Issues

- If generation fails, try again with more specific context
- Ensure your topic has a clear title and description
- Try generating fewer outcomes at once

### Saving Issues

- Ensure all required fields are completed
- Check that you've selected at least one action verb
- Verify your statement is not empty
