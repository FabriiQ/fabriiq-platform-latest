# Bloom's Taxonomy, Rubrics, and Topic Mastery Integration

This feature provides a comprehensive implementation of Bloom's Taxonomy, rubrics, and topic mastery tracking for the Q2 Learning platform. It enables educators to create curriculum, lesson plans, activities, and assessments aligned with Bloom's cognitive levels, track student mastery across these levels, and provide targeted feedback using structured rubrics.

## Overview

The integration of Bloom's Taxonomy, Rubrics, and Topic Mastery into our system enhances the educational value of our platform by:

1. Aligning learning objectives with specific cognitive levels
2. Providing structured, criteria-based assessment tools
3. Leveraging our existing agentic orchestration for AI-enhanced assessment creation
4. Enabling more meaningful feedback and student growth
5. Tracking student mastery across cognitive levels
6. Providing targeted recommendations based on mastery gaps

## Key Components

### 1. Bloom's Taxonomy Integration

- **Cognitive Levels**: Implements the six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create)
- **Action Verbs**: Provides suggested action verbs for each cognitive level
- **Distribution Visualization**: Shows the distribution of cognitive levels across curriculum, lesson plans, and assessments
- **Classification**: Helps classify content by Bloom's level

### 2. Rubrics

- **Rubric Builder**: Enhanced rubric builder with Bloom's Taxonomy integration
- **Performance Levels**: Configurable performance levels with descriptions and score ranges
- **Criteria**: Criteria aligned with Bloom's cognitive levels
- **Templates**: Reusable rubric templates for common assessment types

### 3. Topic Mastery

- **Mastery Tracking**: Tracks student mastery across Bloom's cognitive levels
- **Visualization**: Visualizes mastery using radar charts and progress indicators
- **Analytics**: Provides detailed analytics for students and classes
- **Recommendations**: Generates targeted recommendations based on mastery gaps

### 4. Activities

- **Activity Templates**: Templates for activities aligned with Bloom's cognitive levels
- **Activity Generation**: AI-assisted generation of activities targeting specific cognitive levels
- **Activity Sequences**: Creates balanced sequences of activities for lesson plans
