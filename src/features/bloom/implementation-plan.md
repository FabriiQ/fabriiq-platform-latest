## Risk Management

### Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Risk**: Schema changes disrupt existing functionality
   **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and backward compatibility layer

2. **Risk**: Agent accuracy for Bloom's classification is insufficient
   **Mitigation**: Implement human review process and continuous training

3. **Risk**: Complex UI creates user adoption challenges
   **Mitigation**: Iterative design with teacher feedback and simplified workflows

4. **Risk**: Performance issues with enhanced assessment data
   **Mitigation**: Early performance testing and optimization

5. **Risk**: Timeline delays due to integration complexity
   **Mitigation**: Phased approach with independent components that can be released incrementally
