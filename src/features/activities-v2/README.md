# Activities V2 Implementation

A modern, scalable activities system for the FabriiQ platform that replaces the complex legacy system with three core activity types: Quiz, Reading, and Video.

## 🎯 Overview

Activities V2 is designed with the following principles:
- **Minimal & Efficient**: Clean architecture without over-engineering
- **Question Bank Integration**: Primary source for all quiz questions
- **Grading System Alignment**: Full integration with existing grading infrastructure
- **Achievement System**: Customizable points, bonuses, and celebrations
- **Time Tracking**: Built-in learning time tracking and analytics

### Activity Types

1. **Quiz Activities**
   - Question Bank integration
   - Multiple question types support
   - Auto-grading with existing grading system
   - Customizable settings (time limits, attempts, feedback)

2. **Reading Activities**
   - Rich text, URL, or file-based content
   - Progress tracking (scroll percentage, time spent)
   - Interactive features (bookmarks, highlights, notes)
   - Completion criteria

3. **Video Activities**
   - YouTube, Vimeo, file, and HLS stream support
   - Watch progress tracking
   - Completion criteria (watch percentage, time)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

The Activities V2 system is already integrated into the existing FabriiQ codebase. No additional installation is required.

### Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:activities-v2

# Run specific test types
npm run test:activities-v2:types      # TypeScript type checking
npm run test:activities-v2:jest       # Jest unit tests
npm run test:activities-v2:integration # Integration tests
```

### Usage

#### Creating Activities

```typescript
import { ActivityV2Creator } from '@/features/activities-v2/components/ActivityV2Creator';

// In your component
<ActivityV2Creator
  classId="class-123"
  subjectId="subject-123"
  topicId="topic-123"
  onSuccess={(activity) => console.log('Created:', activity)}
  onCancel={() => console.log('Cancelled')}
/>
```

#### Viewing Activities

```typescript
import { ActivityV2Viewer } from '@/features/activities-v2/components/ActivityV2Viewer';

// In your component
<ActivityV2Viewer
  activityId="activity-123"
  onComplete={(result) => console.log('Completed:', result)}
  onBack={() => console.log('Back pressed')}
/>
```

## 🔧 API Integration

### tRPC Endpoints

Activities V2 provides the following tRPC endpoints:

```typescript
// Create activity
const activity = await api.activityV2.create.mutate({
  title: "Sample Quiz",
  subjectId: "subject-123",
  classId: "class-123",
  content: quizContent
});

// Submit activity
const result = await api.activityV2.submit.mutate({
  activityId: "activity-123",
  answers: { "q1": "answer1" },
  timeSpent: 1800
});

// Get activity
const activity = await api.activityV2.getById.query({
  activityId: "activity-123"
});

// Get student attempts
const attempts = await api.activityV2.getAttempts.query({
  activityId: "activity-123",
  studentId: "student-123"
});
```

4. **Feature Parity**: All V1 features available in V2 with improved UX

## 🎯 Achievement System

### Configuration Options

```typescript
achievementConfig: {
  enabled: true,
  pointsAnimation: true,
  celebrationLevel: 'standard', // 'minimal' | 'standard' | 'enthusiastic'
  points: {
    base: 20,
    perfectScore: 10,
    speedBonus: 5,
    firstAttempt: 5
  },
  triggers: {
    completion: true,
    perfectScore: true,
    speedBonus: true,
    firstAttempt: true,
    improvement: false
  }
}
```

### Integration

The achievement system integrates with:
- Existing points and grading system
- Time tracking for speed bonuses
- Student progress analytics
- Celebration animations

## 📊 Analytics Integration

Activities V2 provides rich analytics data:
- Question-level performance metrics
- Time spent per activity section
- Engagement patterns (bookmarks, notes, replays)
- Completion rates and attempt patterns

## 🔒 Security & Validation

- Input validation using Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma ORM
- User authentication and authorization
- Content sanitization for rich text

## 🚀 Performance

- Lazy loading of components
- Efficient Question Bank queries
- Optimized video streaming
- Progress tracking with minimal overhead

## 📝 Contributing

When contributing to Activities V2:

1. Follow the existing code patterns
2. Add tests for new features
3. Update type definitions
4. Run the test suite before submitting
5. Ensure grading system alignment

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
