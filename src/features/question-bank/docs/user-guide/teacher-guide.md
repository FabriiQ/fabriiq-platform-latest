### Creating Effective Multiple Choice Questions

Multiple choice questions are one of the most common question types. Here are some tips for creating effective multiple choice questions:

1. **Clear Stem**: The question stem should be clear and concise
2. **Plausible Distractors**: All incorrect options should be plausible
3. **Avoid Clues**: Don't include clues to the correct answer (e.g., grammatical clues)
4. **Consistent Length**: Keep options similar in length
5. **Avoid "All of the Above"**: This option is often correct, which can be a clue
6. **Use Positive Language**: Avoid negative wording like "Which of the following is NOT..."
7. **One Correct Answer**: Ensure there is only one clearly correct answer

### Creating Other Question Types

The Question Bank supports various question types. Here are some tips for creating effective questions of different types:

#### True/False Questions

- Make statements clearly true or false
- Avoid ambiguity
- Use precise language

#### Fill in the Blanks Questions

- Provide clear context
- Use blanks for key terms or concepts
- Consider accepting multiple correct answers for each blank

#### Matching Questions

- Use clear, concise items
- Keep the number of items manageable (5-10)
- Make sure there is a clear one-to-one match

#### Short Answer Questions

- Ask specific questions
- Clearly define the expected length
- Consider multiple correct answers

## Using Questions in Activities

2. Click the "Add from Question Bank" button
3. Browse and filter questions in the Question Bank Selector
4. Select the questions you want to add
5. Click "Add Selected Questions"

### Understanding Question Reuse Warnings

When selecting questions for an activity, you may see warnings about question reuse:

- **Used in this class**: The question has been used in the current class before
- **Used recently**: The question has been used in the current class recently
- **Used in multiple activities**: The question has been used in multiple activities in the current class

These warnings help you avoid reusing questions that students have already seen.

### Creating a Balanced Quiz

When creating a quiz, consider the following:

1. **Mix Question Types**: Include a variety of question types
2. **Vary Difficulty**: Include questions of varying difficulty
3. **Cover Key Concepts**: Ensure the quiz covers the key concepts from the lesson
4. **Appropriate Length**: Keep the quiz length appropriate for the time available
5. **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear instructions for each question type

## Analyzing Question Performance

### Viewing Question Analytics

1. Navigate to a question in the question bank
2. Click the "Analytics" tab
3. You will see analytics about the question's usage and performance:
   - Usage count
   - Correct answer percentage
   - Average time to answer
   - Difficulty rating based on student performance
   - Usage history

### Interpreting Question Analytics

The analytics can help you understand how effective your questions are:

- **Correct Answer Percentage**: 
  - Very low (0-30%): The question might be too difficult or poorly worded
  - Moderate (30-70%): The question is likely at an appropriate difficulty
  - Very high (70-100%): The question might be too easy

- **Average Time to Answer**:
  - Very short: The question might be too easy or obvious
  - Very long: The question might be too complex or confusing

- **Difficulty Rating**:
  - This is calculated based on student performance
  - It may differ from your assigned difficulty level

### Using Analytics to Improve Questions

Based on the analytics, you can improve your questions:

1. **Revise Difficult Questions**: If a question has a very low correct answer percentage, consider revising it to make it clearer
2. **Replace Easy Questions**: If a question has a very high correct answer percentage, consider replacing it with a more challenging question
3. **Clarify Confusing Questions**: If a question takes a long time to answer, consider clarifying the wording
4. **Create Similar Questions**: For frequently used questions, create similar questions to avoid overuse
