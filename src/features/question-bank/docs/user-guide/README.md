### Using Analytics to Improve Questions

The analytics can help you improve your questions:

- If a question has a very high correct answer percentage, it might be too easy
- If a question takes a long time to answer, it might be too complex or confusing
- If a question is used frequently, consider creating similar questions to avoid overuse
