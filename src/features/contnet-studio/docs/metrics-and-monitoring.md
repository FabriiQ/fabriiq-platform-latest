**Measurement Method**: Error logging in production.

## User Satisfaction Metrics

### 1. Preview Success Rate

**Definition**: The percentage of AI-generated content that is successfully previewed by users.

**Calculation**:
```
Preview Success Rate = (Successful Previews / Total Preview Attempts) * 100
```

**Target**: 99%

**Measurement Method**: User event tracking in production.

### 2. Editor Success Rate

**Definition**: The percentage of AI-generated content that is successfully edited by users.

**Calculation**:
```
Editor Success Rate = (Successful Edits / Total Edit Attempts) * 100
```

**Target**: 99%

**Measurement Method**: User event tracking in production.

### 3. User Error Rate

**Definition**: The percentage of users who encounter errors when using the AI Studio.

**Calculation**:
```
User Error Rate = (Users with Errors / Total Users) * 100
```

**Target**: < 1%

**Measurement Method**: Error tracking and user session analysis in production.

### 4. User Satisfaction Score

**Definition**: The average satisfaction score reported by users when using the AI Studio.

**Calculation**: Average of user satisfaction scores (1-5 scale).

**Target**: > 4.5

**Measurement Method**: User surveys and feedback forms.

## Performance Metrics

### 1. Mapping Latency

**Definition**: The time it takes to map an activity type to an activity type ID.

**Calculation**: Average time in milliseconds for mapping operations.

**Target**: < 1ms

**Measurement Method**: Performance monitoring in production.

### 2. Component Loading Latency

**Definition**: The time it takes to load an activity type component.

**Calculation**: Average time in milliseconds for component loading operations.

**Target**: < 100ms

**Measurement Method**: Performance monitoring in production.

### 3. Content Transformation Latency

**Definition**: The time it takes to transform AI-generated content.

**Calculation**: Average time in milliseconds for content transformation operations.

**Target**: < 10ms

**Measurement Method**: Performance monitoring in production.

### 4. Preview Rendering Latency

**Definition**: The time it takes to render a preview of AI-generated content.

**Calculation**: Average time in milliseconds for preview rendering operations.

**Target**: < 200ms

**Measurement Method**: Performance monitoring in production.

## Monitoring Approach

### 1. Real-Time Monitoring

**Tools**: Datadog, New Relic, or similar APM tool

**Metrics Monitored**:
- Mapping accuracy
- Component loading success rate
- Content transformation success rate
- Fallback usage rate
- Error rates
- Latency metrics

**Alerting**: Alerts will be triggered when:
- Mapping accuracy falls below 99%
- Component loading success rate falls below 99%
- Content transformation success rate falls below 99%
- Fallback usage rate exceeds 5%
- Any error rate exceeds 1%
- Any latency metric exceeds its target by 50%

### 2. User Experience Monitoring

**Tools**: Google Analytics, Hotjar, or similar user analytics tool

**Metrics Monitored**:
- Preview success rate
- Editor success rate
- User error rate
- User satisfaction score
- User session duration
- User session abandonment rate

**Alerting**: Alerts will be triggered when:
- Preview success rate falls below 95%
- Editor success rate falls below 95%
- User error rate exceeds 5%
- User satisfaction score falls below 4.0

### 3. Error Tracking

**Tools**: Sentry, Rollbar, or similar error tracking tool

**Metrics Monitored**:
- Mapping errors
- Component loading errors
- Content transformation errors
- Fallback errors
- JavaScript errors
- API errors

**Alerting**: Alerts will be triggered when:
- Any error occurs more than 10 times in an hour
- Any new error type is detected
- Any error affects more than 1% of users

### 4. Performance Monitoring
