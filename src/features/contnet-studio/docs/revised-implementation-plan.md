# Content Studio Revised Implementation Plan

This document outlines the revised implementation plan for the Content Studio, focusing on a page-based navigation approach rather than dialog-based flows.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Content Type Selection Page

- Create a landing page for content type selection
  - Implement content type cards with icons (Activity, Assessment, Worksheet, Lesson Plan)
  - Add selection handling that navigates to the appropriate creation page
  - Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop

### 2. Shared Components

- Create reusable components for all content creation pages:
  - ClassSelector: For selecting the class context
  - SubjectSelector: For selecting the subject
  - TopicSelector: For selecting topics (hierarchical)
  - LearningObjectivesSelector: For selecting learning objectives
  - CreationMethodSelector: For choosing between manual and AI-assisted creation
