# Circle Feature - Student Social Learning

## Overview

The Circle feature provides students with a visual representation of their learning community, showing classmates and teachers in each class. This promotes social learning and helps students feel connected to their peers.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Class Member Display**: Shows all students and teachers in a class
- **Profile Cards**: Clean cards with name, photo, and role
- **Class Context**: Clear indication of which class the circle represents
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop

### User Experience
- **Social Learning Theory**: Reduces isolation in online learning
- **Peer Awareness**: Visual representation of learning community
- **Belonging & Connection**: Fulfills need for relatedness
- **Simple & Focused**: No complex social features, just peer visibility

## Implementation

### API Endpoints
- `circle.getClassMembers` - Get all members for a specific class
- `circle.getStudentClassesWithMembers` - Get student's classes with member counts
- `circle.checkClassAccess` - Verify user access to class circle

### Components
- `MemberCard` - Individual member display with avatar and role
- `CircleGrid` - Responsive grid layout for member cards
- `CircleHeader` - Page header with class info and navigation
- `ClassSelector` - Class selection interface for main circle page

### Pages
- `/student/circle` - Main circle page showing all classes
- `/student/circle/[classId]` - Class-specific circle showing all members

### Navigation Integration
- Added to StudentShell main navigation
- Added to StudentSidebar class-specific navigation
- Accessible from both main portal and within classes

## Database Queries

The Circle feature uses existing database models:
- `StudentEnrollment` - For class students
- `TeacherAssignment` - For class teachers
- `User` - For member information
- `Class` - For class details

## Styling & Animations

### CSS Features
- Fade-in animations for member cards
- Staggered loading animations
- Hover effects and transitions
- Current user highlighting with shimmer effect
- Responsive grid layouts
- Accessibility support (high contrast, reduced motion)

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile**: 2 columns, compact cards
- **Tablet**: 3 columns, medium cards
- **Desktop**: 4-5 columns, full cards

## Accessibility

### Features Implemented
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and roles
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through cards and interactive elements
- **High Contrast**: Clear text and background contrast
- **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus states for keyboard users
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user's motion preferences

### ARIA Labels
- Member cards have descriptive labels
- Role information is properly announced
- Current user status is indicated

## Testing Checklist

### Functionality Tests
- [ ] Main circle page loads and shows enrolled classes
- [ ] Class-specific circle page shows all members
- [ ] Teachers are displayed first, then students
- [ ] Current user is highlighted appropriately
- [ ] Navigation works between pages
- [ ] Access control prevents unauthorized viewing

### Responsive Tests
- [ ] Mobile layout works correctly
- [ ] Tablet layout displays properly
- [ ] Desktop layout shows optimal columns
- [ ] Cards resize appropriately
- [ ] Navigation is accessible on all screen sizes

### Accessibility Tests
- [ ] Screen reader announces content correctly
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works through all elements
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible
- [ ] High contrast mode is supported
- [ ] Reduced motion preferences are respected

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Pages load quickly with proper loading states
- [ ] API calls are optimized (single calls vs multiple)
- [ ] Images load efficiently with fallbacks
- [ ] Animations don't impact performance

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```tsx
// Main circle page
<ClassSelector
  classes={classes}
  onClassSelect={(classId) => router.push(`/student/circle/${classId}`)}
/>

// Class-specific circle
<CircleGrid
  members={members}
  currentUserId={userId}
  classInfo={classInfo}
/>
```

### API Usage
```tsx
// Get class members
const { data } = api.circle.getClassMembers.useQuery({ classId });

// Get student's classes
const { data } = api.circle.getStudentClassesWithMembers.useQuery();
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features (Not in Current Scope)
- Online status indicators
- Direct messaging integration
- Achievement comparisons
- Study group formation
- Peer collaboration tools

### Performance Optimizations
- Image optimization and caching
- Pagination for large classes
- Real-time updates for member status
- Offline support for cached data

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Students can only view circles for classes they're enrolled in
- Teachers can view circles for classes they teach
- Proper authentication and authorization checks
- No sensitive information exposed

### Privacy
- Only basic profile information is shown
- Respects user privacy settings
- No personal contact information displayed
- Secure API endpoints with proper validation

## Deployment Notes

### Requirements
- Next.js 15.2.2+
- tRPC for API calls
- Prisma for database access
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Environment Setup
- Ensure database has proper indexes for performance
- Configure proper CORS settings
- Set up proper error logging
- Test with realistic data volumes

This implementation provides a solid foundation for social learning while maintaining simplicity and focus on the core goal of peer visibility and connection.
